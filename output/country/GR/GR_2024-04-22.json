            "interpretation": "Dreams can have multiple interpretations, as they are deeply personal and can be influenced by individual experiences and emotions. However, seeing a black car (specifically a priest's car) outside a church can symbolize various meanings.\n\n1. Symbolism of authority and spirituality: The black car represents power, authority, and distinction. Seeing it outside a church may suggest a connection between religious or spiritual authority and the institution itself. This could indicate a desire for guidance, support, or seeking answers to spiritual questions.\n\n2. Symbolism of mystery and the unknown: The color black often represents the unknown or hidden aspects of our lives. In this dream, the black car represents that mystery, while the church symbolizes a place of gathering and seeking truth. It could suggest a subconscious yearning to explore deeper aspects of spirituality or religion.\n\n3. Symbolism of transitions: Churches are often associated with significant life transitions, such as weddings or funerals. Seeing the black car outside the church might symbolize an upcoming change or transition in your life that has connections to spirituality or religion. It could be a reminder to seek support during times of change or to find solace in your beliefs.\n\nUltimately, the interpretation of this dream depends on your personal experiences, beliefs, and emotions. Reflecting on your own associations with churches, priests, and black cars may provide additional insights into the specific meaning for you.",
