            "interpretation": "This dream may reflect fears and uncertainties in your current life. The school can symbolize your education or work, and the fire may represent something that threatens to destroy this part of your life, perhaps a big change or a crisis. The fact that you are losing your classmates may reflect a loss of support or difficulty in communicating with others in this situation. The large wooden room may symbolize a safe or comfortable place where you can feel secure in the face of the crisis. The fact that you run faster than your friend may reflect your desire to keep control of the situation, while your friend may represent a calmer or more relaxed side of your personality. The fact that your mother enters the fire to become a firefighter may symbolize a sacrifice or an act of courage in response to the crisis. Ultimately, the fact that everyone survives and that you return to your childhood car may reflect a return to safety and familiarity after a period of stress or chaos.",

            "dream": "I am cleaning a old house that has not been cleaned up for years with a stranger and his toddler child at night. We encounter many struggles and among that is an entrance to the world of snake clan .. The snakes who can change to humans. When we were trying to close the door this child has been abducted by one of the members of snake clan. And I go inside to get back the child. Once I enter it looks like a house and I can see many of my cousins and aunts there as the members of snake clan.  I say one mantra and tell that actual humans should go inside the room. So half my cousins and some kids go into the room. But they are sad. Remaining where my uncles and aunts and some other members of snake clan and i try different mantras but they repeat it with confidence and a smile. Nothing could get them. I was worried and they were laughing. Suddenly I woke up",

            "interpretation": "The dream depicts the journey of personal growth and the struggles and challenges that come with it. The old house that has not been cleaned for years represents a part of your life that needs attention and requires cleaning. The stranger and his child symbolize the unknown journey ahead and the vulnerability that you feel while facing it.\n\nThe snakes that can transform to humans represent the hidden fears and obstacles that you may encounter on your journey. The child's abduction signifies the need to protect your inner child and keep it safe during challenging times. You going inside to rescue the child indicates your willingness to face your fears and overcome obstacles.\n\nYour cousins and aunts as members of the snake clan represent the parts of yourself that are still in the transformation process. You trying different mantras signifies various methods you have tried to deal with the challenges, but only some of your relatives and younger aspects of yourself respond.\n\nThe uncles and aunts and few other clan members repeating the mantras with a smile signifies your transformation process is not yet complete and you still need to work harder on achieving inner peace and understanding. The dream is a reminder that you should continue pursuing personal growth and not give up.",
