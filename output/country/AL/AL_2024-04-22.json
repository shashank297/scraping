            "interpretation": "The dream may represent a situation or problem that you are facing in your waking life. The wolf in the dream can symbolize a threat or fear that you are trying to avoid. Your grandparents' home could represent a sense of safety and security that you seek in your life. \n\nThe fact that the doors and windows were open implies a sense of vulnerability and openness. Perhaps you feel like you are exposing yourself too much to external factors, which can be harmful to you. \n\nThe constant running and escaping from the wolf indicates your struggle to avoid this threat or fear. However, the wolf stopping and calmly leaving could suggest that the issue is not as menacing as you initially thought. You may have been putting too much energy into avoiding something that does not pose a real threat.\n\nClosing all the doors and windows in the house at the end of the dream indicates a desire to protect yourself and keep out any negative influences that may be affecting you. Overall, the dream may be a sign that you need to re-evaluate your sense of safety and security and take steps to protect yourself from potential threats.",

            "interpretation": "Dreams about something happening in real life can be a sign of clairvoyance or a premonition. It could be possible that your subconscious mind sensed a future event based on the information it has received unconsciously. Alternatively, it could be a coincidence, but it's essential to pay attention to the dream's details and compare them with the actual event to see if they match. It's also possible that the dream may have influenced your actions and decisions that led to the situation happening in waking life.",
