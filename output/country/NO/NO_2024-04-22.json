            "interpretation": "Dreams are highly individual and can be influenced by personal experiences, thoughts, and emotions. Therefore, the interpretation of dreams can vary from person to person. However, I can provide you with a general analysis of the symbols in your dream.\n\nThe brother you do not know may represent an unknown or unfamiliar aspect of yourself or your current situation. Hanging out with him in a rainy and dark city, which you used to live in, could symbolize revisiting past emotions or situations that were emotionally challenging or difficult.\n\nThe sudden shape-shifting of his eyes into reptilian eyes may symbolize encountering deceptive or hidden aspects of someone or something in your waking life. This could represent a situation or person who may not be as they appear on the surface. It could suggest a need for caution and discernment in your relationships or circumstances.\n\nThe mention of cocaine abuse in the dream may symbolize a need to escape or cope with difficult emotions or situations. It could be a reflection of a desire for excitement or stimulation, or it could represent feelings of powerlessness or a need for control.\n\nOverall, this dream may point to the importance of paying attention to your intuition and being cautious in your relationships and interactions. It could also be a reminder to address any unresolved emotions or experiences from your past.",
