            "dream": "I dreamt that I was with my family in a residence, having a great time playing when suddenly, the room started shaking violently. Since the city I live in in real life has never experienced any natural disasters, I was extremely terrified by the situation. My mother shouted to turn off the lights and leave the residence, and she rushed out, leaving only me and my sister behind. I took my sister to the terrace and heard people from the opposite side calling out. The residence shook even more violently, and I started thinking about how to minimize the risk of injuries after the earthquake. Then, the building collapsed, and I desperately protected my sister's and my own heads as we fell from a high floor. Afterward, I wasn't seriously injured, but my sister had a swelling at the back of her head. I immediately went to a nearby restaurant to get ice for emergency treatment.",

            "interpretation": "This dream suggests that you have concerns about the safety and well-being of your family. The shaking of the room and the subsequent collapse of the building symbolize a sense of instability and uncertainty in your life. Your fear and desperation to protect your sister indicate your strong sense of responsibility and love for your family.\n\nThe dream may also symbolize your need to take control and make quick decisions in challenging situations. Your mother's command to turn off the lights and leave the residence represents the importance of being proactive and taking immediate action when faced with potentially dangerous circumstances.\n\nThe swelling at the back of your sister's head could represent a metaphorical \"blow\" or hardship that she may face in the future.

I was alone in the back seat. Suddenly, the car started moving forward on its own, and I didn't know how to stop it. I felt panicked and suffocated while sitting in the back seat. After a while, the car crashed into someone else's black car and continued to slide forward on its own. I tried to take deep breaths to calm myself down, but in the end, I couldn't stop the car or control its direction.",

The private car and your family represent familiarity and support, but the fact that they all got out and left you alone suggests a sense of abandonment or being left behind. The car moving forward on its own could reflect situations or circumstances in which you feel swept along without being able to influence the outcome. The feelings of panic, suffocation, and the inability to stop the car or control its direction may indicate a sense of overwhelm and helplessness in facing challenges or difficult situations. It could be beneficial to explore what aspects of your life are causing these feelings and find ways to regain a sense of control and empowerment.",

            "interpretation": "The dream may reflect a sense of change and transformation. The nursing home turning into a coffee shop symbolizes a shift from taking care of others to taking care of oneself or seeking comfort and relaxation. Your mother's presence may represent a nurturing aspect of yourself. The briefcase and laptop on your left could symbolize responsibility and work-related concerns. The unknown man in the suit wanting you to give up your seat could represent external pressures or demands causing you to have to relinquish a sense of comfort or stability.\n\nThe man playing with the kitten suggests a playful and lighthearted moment amidst the restrictions or demands. However, your mother noticing your menstrual bleeding may indicate a sense of vulnerability or feeling exposed. The urgency to cover it with different coats signifies an attempt to hide personal or sensitive matters. The black school coat being too short may imply feeling inadequate or not fully able to conceal those personal aspects. Finally, covering it with a white long down and walking home alone may symbolize finding a more comfortable and secure place where you can be yourself without judgment or scrutiny.\n\nOverall, the dream may reflect a need for self-care, standing up for your own boundaries, and finding a safe space where you can be authentic and accepted.

            "interpretation": "This dream is filled with symbolism, representing various aspects of your emotions and desires.\n\nThe love show in your dream may symbolize your desire for connection and romance. Being assigned to a cage with only a toilet suggests a feeling of confinement and limited options in your love life. Seeing a male guest next door, but not liking it, indicates that you may have certain preferences or specific qualities you are looking for in a romantic partner.\n\nThe act of putting your hand down on the toilet represents your willingness to explore or take risks in relationships. However, feeling disgusted and removing your hand shows that you have certain boundaries or limits when it comes to pursuing love.\n\nThe kitten symbolizes innocence, vulnerability, and playfulness. It laying on you suggests a sense of comfort and warmth. The male guest commenting on the kitten liking your gentle pulse may represent the attraction someone has towards your nurturing and caring nature.\n\nThe entrance of two magicians into the cage and the subsequent theft of your magic wand could signify external forces or distractions that are hindering your ability to manifest love and happiness. However, with the help of your companions (possibly reflecting your support system or close friends), you are able to retrieve your magic wand. This may indicate that despite challenges or setbacks, you have the ability to overcome obstacles and reclaim control over your romantic life.\n\nThe paragliding with paper and breaking the window suggests a sense of liberation, freedom, and adventure. It represents your willingness to take risks and step out of your comfort zone in your pursuit of love. However, losing the paper during the flight may imply that you may face setbacks or temporary losses along the way.\n\nFinally, successfully landing after the flight symbolizes a positive outcome or resolution in your romantic endeavors. It suggests that despite the challenges and ups and downs, you will ultimately find a fulfilling and grounded connection.\n\nOverall, this dream indicates your desire for love, your willingness to take risks and overcome obstacles in pursuit of it, and the potential for a positive outcome in your love life.",

However, I will provide a general interpretation of your dream:\n\nThis dream may not necessarily indicate actual infidelity in your relationship. Instead, it could represent feelings of insecurity, fear, or doubt within yourself. Seeing your boyfriend being gentle with another girl could symbolize your fear of losing his affection and attention. The fact that he didn't push you or disclose your relationship may reflect your apprehension about speaking up for yourself and asserting your boundaries.\n\nThe mention of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day could represent a time of togetherness and celebration, suggesting that deep down, you desire a happy and secure relationship during special moments. Your boyfriend saying that you cannot break up and must be together, even if the situation is for your own benefit, could highlight a fear of being alone or a belief that you need to stay in the relationship for stability or other reasons.\n\nFinally, feeling frightened and gasping for breath upon waking suggests the intensity of your emotions surrounding this dream. It may be a sign that you should examine your feelings of insecurity and fear within your relationship and address any underlying issues or concerns with open communication.\n\nRemember, dream interpretations are subjective, and only you can truly understand the meaning behind your dream. Reflecting on your personal circumstances and emotions can help you gain further insight.",
