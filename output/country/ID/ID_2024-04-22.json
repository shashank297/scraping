            "dream": "I was in a thrift store in Asia, probably Indonesia. But the products in the store were mosty Japanese, I think. There was a lot of cool electronic gadgets and designer second hand clothes. I found one cool clothing piece, but somebody ripped it out of my hand, claiming it was his. Then I realized there's a second floor in this thrift store with even more cool stuff. I started browsing clothes on the hanger, when I felt a strange thing. Somebody was sucking my hand and pulling my sleeve. It turned out it's an old lady who put almost my whole hand in her mouth and was sucking it. I freaked out, wanted to scream for help but my throat was blocked. I started to fight with her. I bumper her head against the shelf. Suddenly she picked up a gun and started shooting in the air. Everyone panicked, me too. I found a way around all the racks with clothes and gadgets and ran down and escaped the store. The local police was already there. I wanted to tell a policeman what happened, I started to talk but he went to the food truck nearby. He ordered a coffee. I continued to tell him my story, but he didn't want to listen. He ignored my attempts to tell it. I went away and the dream eneded. ",

            "interpretation": "This dream is expressing some feelings of being excited about discovering something new and exciting while traveling or exploring your interests. However, it seems there is some sense of competition or conflict as someone takes something you want or desire. The old woman who sucks your hand and causes you to panic could represent a sense of being trapped or feeling powerless in a situation. The police officer ignoring you when you try to tell him what happened suggests a feeling of being dismissed or unheard by authority figures. Overall, this dream may be highlighting some concerns about feeling vulnerable or helpless in new or unfamiliar situations, and possibly a desire for protection or reassurance.",
