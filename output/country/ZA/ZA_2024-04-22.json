            "dream": "I believe that this might have just been ordinary sleep paralysis, but yeah I dreamt that I woke up in my bed. I know it was a dream cause the room was lit with a dark blue light. I felt I couldn't move and there was a small ringing sound in my ear. I wasn't to bothered at first thinking that I should just go back to sleep, but the ringing started to get louder and I still couldn't move. It felt like I was struggling to breathe like I was suffocating and the ringing became  so loud it was deafening I tried to move and couldn't so I tried to jerk my shoulder to get on my back. After the second attempt I succeeded and I woke up in the position I was trapped in",

            "interpretation": "This dream appears to be a classic case of sleep paralysis, which is a relatively common phenomenon. Sleep paralysis occurs when the mind wakes up before the body fully regains its ability to move during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. During sleep paralysis, people often experience a sense of immobility, accompanied by various sensory hallucinations or feelings of pressure on the chest.\n\nIn your dream, the dark blue light in the room may symbolize the boundary between consciousness and the dream state. The feeling of being unable to move and the ringing sound in your ear are typical symptoms of sleep paralysis. The initial lack of concern suggests that you were somewhat aware of the dream state, which is common during sleep paralysis episodes. \n\nThe increasing intensity of the ringing and the feeling of suffocation could be manifestations of anxiety or panic during the dream. It is not uncommon to experience a sense of fear or distress during sleep paralysis due to the disorienting nature of the experience. Your eventual success in jerking your shoulder and waking up indicates that the dream cycle ended and you were able to regain control of your physical body.\n\nOverall, this dream is likely a reflection of your personal experience with sleep paralysis. It can be helpful to remember that sleep paralysis is a natural process and not harmful, even though it can be unsettling. If you frequently experience sleep paralysis and it disrupts your sleep or causes distress, it may be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional for further guidance.",

So I jumped in the water and swam to the bottom. The bottom was filled with what looked like glowing blue stones. I started ti dig through the stones until they were no longer blue, but looked burning coal. I thought to myself that I should be careful not to dig to deep or I'll end up in hell and sure enough as I looked up there were to black gates and behind it was hell. When I woke up I laughed at how funny it was",

It suggests that you are seeking excitement, opportunities, or rewards.\n\nJumping into the water and swimming to the bottom represents your willingness to take risks and dive deep into the unknown or hidden aspects of yourself or a situation. The glowing blue stones that later turn into burning coal may represent the transformative nature of your search for treasure. It could indicate that the pursuit of your goals may initially seem promising and captivating but may eventually become challenging and demanding.\n\nThe reference to being careful not to dig too deep or end up in hell reflects your recognition of potential consequences or negative outcomes if you become too consumed or obsessed with your pursuit. It may indicate a need for balance and caution in your actions or decisions.\n\nThe fact that you laughed upon waking suggests that you find humor in the irony or unexpected turns in your dream. It could indicate that you have a lighthearted attitude towards challenges or setbacks, and you find amusement in the role-playing nature of dreams.",

He agreed and we went out having small talk and a group of his friends joined us. There were males and females. We all started talking and had a good time until everyone's faces just went emotionless and starred in front of them. The all started running in a perfect straight line in the direction they were facing. I distinctly recall how they almost bumped into each other while they were running on their own path. I was asking the guy who I originally bumped it what was going on, and he didn't know either and started running after one of his girlfriends. I followed him until he sunddenly turned around facing me and gave a aggressive deafening scream",

However, here is one possible interpretation of the dream you described:\n\nThe dream may symbolize your desire for connection and social interaction, as depicted by going to a bar with your mother and engaging in conversation with the stranger and his friends. The sudden change in their emotions and robotic-like behavior could represent a loss of authentic connection or a sense of conformity, where everyone starts running in separate paths without any individuality or personal expression. This could reflect feelings of isolation or a fear of losing your own identity in a group setting.\n\nThe aggressive scream from the guy you originally bumped into may represent a release of pent-up emotions or frustration, potentially reflecting your own inner turmoil or conflicts. It could also suggest that certain individuals or situations in your waking life may initially seem friendly or engaging, but can quickly turn aggressive or unpredictable.\n\nOverall, this dream may be a reflection of your subconscious thoughts and concerns about social interactions, conformity, and the fear of losing your individuality within a group.",

All of a sudden a small wave breaks on the side of my boat and splashed me, as soon as it happened to me, it also happened to the man on the TV, because he said so. I thought it was very strange, but then the voices wasn't coming from the TV anymore, but in my head. And it was my voice, but I had no control over it. It started to mock and bully me, and even started to sing a song that was berating me. I soon realised that I knew the words he was going to sing before he sang them.

            "interpretation": "The dream you described could reflect various aspects of your subconscious mind. Being on a boat in the middle of the ocean symbolizes a sense of journey or exploration in your life. Watching a tutorial on how to make a pizza on a boat suggests that you are seeking ways to find enjoyment or pleasure in challenging or unexpected situations.\n\nThe voice on the TV represents external influences or messages that you are receiving, while not being able to see the man could imply a lack of clarity or understanding regarding these influences. The small wave breaking on the side of the boat signifies a disruption or change that affects both you and the man on the TV, indicating a shared experience or connection.\n\nWhen the voices transition from the TV to your head and become your own voice, it suggests that the external influences have turned internal, and your subconscious mind is now speaking to you. The mocking and bullying could indicate self-doubt or negative self-talk that you may be experiencing in waking life.\n\nThe ability to know and change the words being sung demonstrates a growing awareness and control over your own thoughts and emotions. The phrase \"this is my voice, I am in control\" conveys a desire to assert your independence and take charge of your own inner dialogue.\n\nAccidentally accenting from the boat could symbolize a desire to distance yourself from the negativity or self-criticism and move towards a more positive mindset or a sense of personal empowerment.\n\nOverall, this dream suggests that you are navigating through a process of self-discovery, trying to find joy in challenging situations, and working towards gaining control over your own thoughts and emotions. It may indicate a need to be kinder to yourself and develop a stronger sense of self-confidence.",

However, feeling powerless or unable to control the dream reflects a feeling of helplessness or lack of control in your waking life.\n\nWhen you convince yourself that you should be the one who is feared, it may suggest a desire to regain control or assert yourself in the face of challenges. Charging at the man signifies confronting your fears or taking a proactive approach.

            "dream": "There were some two boys of my age who were pulling a Sheep with a rope. The rope was tied on the sheep's neck. This sheep was most beautiful and very huge. It had the best genetics I have ever seen from a sheep. It was male in gender. When the boys were pulling it I really wished to have a female sheep of mine so that I can breed it with this sheep to pass its genetics. But at some point this sheep lended in my hands. I was then the one pulling it instead of those two boys. When I was the one pulling it, I decided to take it to a place with people I know may have sheep's too, and I wanted this sheep to breed with theirs so that the genes can be passed on. Hoping that one day when I have a sheep It will get those genes from the babies of the sheeps I made breed with this sheep with the best genes. Unfortunately I wasn't lucky enough to get sheeps where I went to. One strange thing is that when I was still walking with this sheep pulling it with a rope on its neck, it ran to some yard along the road and there were goats there, it tried to mate or breed with one goat but the attempts failed. Towards the end of my dream, this sheep was now starting to be aggressive with me. It wanted to escape and go to the boys it was initially with. Or to its rightful owners. Its aggressiveness was that of a huge dog. It tried to bit me like a dog, and was attempting to escape the rope and run away. I spent the rest of the time trying to ensure that it doesn't escape. Especially escaping without me finding sheeps it will pass its genes on. My older brother was now with me trying to assist me so that the sheep doesn't escape. In the midst of all that, I noticed a police van from distance, and I happen to know that the police were with the two boys who are the owners of this sheep. They were looking for it if o it was a stolen sheep now. Smelling trouble, all I then wanted was to leave the sheep tied to a huge stone with its rope so that it doesn't run away and the police don't find it with me. At that point the urguement was heated up with my brother. I just saw him not being resourceful in helping me achieve all that. He even got mad me and tried to be physical with me with his aggressiveness. I shamed him because the aggressiveness he showed was the one I wanted him to invest in trying to make sure that the sheep doesn't escape since it was now aggressively trying to escape from my hands.",
