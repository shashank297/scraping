            "interpretation": "In dream symbolism, lighthouses often represent guidance or direction. The fact that there are two lighthouses may represent a decision you need to make or two different options you're considering. Additionally, the fact that the lighthouses are on a grassy mountain could mean that this decision or direction is related to personal growth or trying to reach a higher level.\n\nThe puzzle piece framing the lighthouses may indicate that there are pieces coming together in this decision-making process and things are starting to make sense. \n\nSeagulls often represent freedom and a desire for travel or new experiences. Seeing three of them fly up and away towards a cloud could indicate that you're feeling a sense of wanderlust or have a desire to explore new horizons. This dream may be encouraging you to embrace this desire and move forward in pursuit of new experiences and growth.",

            "interpretation": "This dream may be interpreted as a representation of your current fears and concerns about losing things that are important to you in your waking life. The train represents your journey or path in life, while your hand luggage may represent your emotional baggage or the things that you hold dear. The warning from your colleague may be a reflection of the external warnings or advice you have received while taking risks in your life. \n\nThe fear of losing your luggage and the stress that comes with it in your dream may suggest that you are anxious about potential losses or setbacks in your waking life. The reference to a warzone may be a symbol of the turbulent or chaotic situations that you may be facing, leading to feelings of being unprepared and overwhelmed. \n\nOverall, this dream may be telling you to be cautious and mindful of the potential consequences of your actions in order to avoid potential losses and setbacks. It may also be encouraging you to seek support and assistance from others when facing challenging situations.",

            "interpretation": "Dreams are heavily symbolic, and each symbol can represent different things for different people. However, here is a possible interpretation:\n\nThe window in the dream can represent a barrier or a boundary. The stones that have blinded you could indicate a situation that has caused you to be stuck or unable to see things clearly. The flock of starlings flying straight at you can represent a sudden event or situation that has caught your attention. You jumping may indicate you being startled by this event.\n\nThe white mouse running from behind a wall could indicate something hidden or secret that you may be aware of, but not want to acknowledge. The red eyes of the mouse may symbolize feelings of guilt or shame associated with this knowledge. The mouse leaping into its hole might symbolize how you may attempt to bury or forget about this secret.\n\nOverall, this dream may be encouraging you to be more aware of what is happening around you and to confront anything that you may be avoiding. It may also suggest a need to break away from any obstacles obstructing your view.",

The keys that you dropped could represent something valuable or important to you that you have lost or misplaced. The fact that you had to go down the cliff to retrieve them may symbolize your willingness to face the challenge or difficulty in order to regain what you lost. Your mother's shouting could suggest feelings of pressure or criticism from the people around you, which may be contributing to your sense of stress or frustration. Overall, this dream might be a reflection of your subconscious mind's attempt to process and solve a problem in your waking life.",

The Asian woman in your dream may represent a part of yourself that is more in tune with your emotions or intuition.

The dog barking could represent a part of yourself or someone else who is trying to help you through this difficult time. \nThe fact that your jacket was not dirty after falling in the canal could suggest that you were able to avoid a more serious or damaging situation than you first thought. However, the old and dirty money bill could symbolize feelings of being stuck or stagnant in your financial or material situation. \nOverall, this dream could be a reflection of some emotional struggles you are going through and a reminder to seek support from those around you.
