We were cycling through an area with a lot of hills and big trees, the road was curvy with sharp turns. A dark green car suddenly came around the corner of the sharp turn, he almost hit us. I was screaming but my boyfriend was sure we would be fine, and that cycling like this was not dangerous at all. ",

The bike ride on the curvy road with sharp turns symbolizes the ups and downs of your relationship. Your boyfriend being seated backwards and not driving the bike in the right direction represents a lack of control or direction in the relationship. The dark green car that almost hits you could represent a potential obstacle or challenge that you may face. Your boyfriend's confidence in the face of danger may suggest that he is not taking your concerns seriously.

            "interpretation": "Dreams about walking in suburban American with someone, especially a well-known figure like President Jimmy Carter, can often be associated with feelings of nostalgia and familiarity. The fact that you discovered a 3 foot high bottle of vodka in the shape of Jesus on the cross suggests a potential conflict or contradiction between your spiritual beliefs and your desire to indulge in vices. The fact that the bottle was for sale at half the cost and you bought it even though it was wobbly and not stable indicates that you may be tempted to make impulsive decisions and take risks that could have negative consequences. The cluttered front yard outside of the garage symbolizes a chaotic and disorganized environment in your waking life. The empty garage reflects the sense of emptiness and lack of purpose you may be experiencing. The car driving out of the garage when you arrived suggests that you may be missing opportunities or feeling left behind. Overall, this dream may be signaling the need to reconcile your spiritual beliefs with your desires, and to bring order and structure into your life in order to achieve your goals.",

            "interpretation": "This dream may symbolize your desires to adopt a spiritual lifestyle. The presence of former President Jimmy Carter, known for his devout Christianity, reinforces this interpretation. The vodka bottle in the shape of Jesus on the cross may symbolize a mixing of material and spiritual desires, as alcohol represents a physical pleasure while the cross represents spiritual devotion. Your insistence on not wanting the bottle dropped may signify a fear of failing to maintain this balance between material and spiritual needs. Overall, this dream may prompt you to introspect about your spirituality and materialism and find a balance that works for you.",

The fact that nobody believed you could suggest that you feel as though your concerns or fears are being dismissed or overlooked by those closest to you.

At one moment there was a man at the market who was just staring at me when i peaked trough the window. Then at night when the market was gone, the man was still standing looking at me when i peaked trough the window. This went on days after days. Till one time at night the man was gone and a shadow slipped underneath the door. I slept in my moms bedroom and said to my mom: \u201cmom there is someone or something in the house\u201d she told me: \u201cno there is no one, go back to sleep\u201d. Then i heard loud footsteps coming upstairs. And still my mom did not respond and did not believe me. Then the lights went flickering really fast and my heartbeat went crazy. Then when i blinked a clone of me and my mom were standing right in front of the bed just looking at me while my real mom did not see them. Then right before they went to jumpscare me i woke up in real life with sweat everywhere and a razing heart beat.",

The day and night transition with the market disappearing at night could indicate a loss of control or security in a familiar setting. The man staring at you could represent a sense of paranoia or feeling watched or judged. The shadow slipping under the door may symbolize a feeling of unseen danger or unknown forces at play. Your mom's lack of response and disbelief could convey a feeling of being unsupported or misunderstood by loved ones. The clone of you and your mom may represent a distorted self-image or an internal conflict within yourself. The jump scare at the end of the dream may represent a sudden fear or realization that you are not in control of certain aspects of your life.
