            "interpretation": "This dream appears to be a combination of various symbols and elements. When interpreting dreams, it's important to remember that the meaning can vary for each individual. However, here is a possible interpretation for your dream:\n\nThe old lady in the supermarket represents wisdom, guidance, and possibly your subconscious connection to a higher power. By claiming to be God, she symbolizes authority and divine knowledge. Her ability to grow plants out of nothing may represent her power to create and nurture life, suggesting that she has the ability to manifest things from seemingly nothing.\n\nThe mention of a moment of crisis indicates that you are facing some challenges or uncertainties in your waking life. The old lady's advice to trust your little brother suggests that you should have faith in your brother's abilities or judgment during difficult times. This may imply that he possesses qualities or strengths that can guide or support you through tough situations.\n\nThe dream then shifts to a volcanic eruption in the middle of Dubai. Volcanoes often symbolize intense emotions, pent-up frustrations, or sudden transformation. The occurrence of lava suggests that these emotions or changes are becoming visible or bubbling up to the surface. The fact that your brother is going to take you out of the country in response to this crisis may indicate that he represents a source of escape or relief from these overwhelming emotions or circumstances.\n\nOverall, this dream may be highlighting the need for trust and reliance on your little brother's support during challenging times. It also suggests that you have access to inner wisdom or guidance to overcome obstacles and that your subconscious mind may be urging you to embrace it. Ultimately, how you resonate with these symbols and their interpretations may differ, so it's important to consider your own unique emotions and experiences in relation to the dream.",

            "interpretation": "This dream can be interpreted in various ways. A possible interpretation is that your old schoolmates represent your past and the nostalgia associated with it. Playing nerf tag suggests a desire for playfulness and fun in your current environment. The abandoned theatre and the crying baby can symbolize neglected or forgotten aspects of your past. The toddler in yellow and red clothes can be a representation of innocence and joy, but the figure behind it may suggest hidden or darker parts of yourself that you haven't yet faced. The figure coming closer to you could mean that you feel trapped or threatened by this unresolved aspect of your past. It's possible that these unresolved issues may be holding you back from fully enjoying your present and future.",

            "dream": "We were going on a ski trip in Canada. It was a family road trip with my aunt whom I hadn't seen in years. Once we arrived, we went skiing. All of a sudden, I flew up very high while using a ski sled. If I hadn't grabbed onto the ski lift, I would have died. So, I grabbed onto it. Being very high up in the sky, I was scared and panicked. I was screaming for help, but no one noticed me. It was as if my voice was muffled. However, soon I calmed down quickly. I sought to think rationally and realized that if I simply held onto the zipline carrying the ski lift, I could slowly move forward and catch a ski lift. So, I remained calm, with my mind still and my hand secure. All of a sudden, when my mind was calm, I called for help, and everyone heard and understood my voice. Even so, at that point, I didn't need anybody's help. By that point, I had been patiently waiting for an opportunity to grab a hold of a ski lift. It felt as if asking for help would only lower my chances of survival. Yet, for some reason, I still did it alone. I grabbed onto the ski lift, and it safely took me over to the departure area where I was no longer in danger.\n\nNow, for the second part. After I descended safely, I was reunited with my family. We were walking to our reserved hotel in the snowy mountains. The walk to the hotel was nice. Since we were atop a mountain, we could see distant mountains and valleys. But all of a sudden, I had a feeling from another dream, a sort of otherworldly feeling I had never experienced in the mortal world, only in my dreams. In the far distance, lights, rainbows, and a green aurora arose, like the ones they have in the northern hemisphere. After seeing that, my mind turned inside out. It felt so familiar, yet it only gave me a sense of familiarity in my dreams. It felt so new, like an emerging distant power, a foreign object. The idea of it was so beautiful, an unknown and distant entity emitting a sense of metamorphosis. However, it also felt dangerous, as if it could consume you, swallow you whole, and make you an unfamiliar person even to yourself. It felt powerful, and it felt like it was approaching. It was so vast, something I might not be able to avoid. I had the feeling that it was looking at me. ",

            "interpretation": "The dream appears to be about facing challenges and taking control in difficult situations. The ski trip may represent a challenging, but exciting situation that requires skills and perseverance to navigate. Your flight up high on the ski sled may represent a feeling of being out of control or overwhelmed. However, your ability to find a rational solution reveals your inner strength and ability to overcome obstacles. The theme of being alone and self-reliant also emerges in this part of the dream, suggesting a need to trust and rely on oneself.\n\nThe lights, rainbows, and green aurora in the distance may symbolize a new and transformative experience or opportunity that lies ahead. The dreamer seems to sense the beauty and power of this opportunity but also feels intimidated by its unknown qualities. The sense of danger and vulnerability in the dream may reflect a fear of change or stepping outside of one's familiar comfort zone. Overall, this dream encourages taking risks, facing challenges, and trusting one's abilities, even in the face of the unknown.",
