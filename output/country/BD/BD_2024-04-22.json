            "interpretation": "To dream about going abroad on a plane that resembles a roller coaster suggests a sense of uncertainty and instability in your waking life. The roller coaster-like plane may symbolize that the journey ahead may be unpredictable and turbulent. It could also represent your fear of the unknown, challenges or obstacles you may face on your journey.\n\nAlternatively, the dream may reveal your longing for a sense of excitement and adventure in your life. You may be seeking new experiences, cultures, and perspectives by traveling abroad.\n\nConsider your personal life situation and identify if there are any upcoming changes or challenges that may have triggered the dream. You may benefit from facing your fears and embracing the unknown to overcome any obstacles ahead.",

Falling from a tall building could represent a fear of failing or losing control of a situation.

However, the white cloud you fall from could suggest that you have found a solution or a way out of this challenging situation. Perhaps, this dream could be a sign of hope, reminding you that even when things seem to be falling apart, there is always a chance for a positive outcome.",
