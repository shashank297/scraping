            "interpretation": "This dream appears to be a combination of various symbols and themes that could hold personal significance to you. However, I can provide a general analysis based on the elements present in your dream.\n\nThe dream seems to revolve around the exploration of your partner's family roots and the discovery of hidden information or connections. The trip to Wales represents a quest for knowledge about your partner's father's family. Your mother's presence suggests her support and guidance in this journey.\n\nThe key symbolizes access to important information or insights. It may represent an opportunity to unlock secrets or uncover hidden truths about your partner's family history. The fact that both you and your brother receive keys suggests that this journey is significant for your entire family.\n\nUpon arriving at the pier, the ocean represents the vastness of the unknown. Jumping onto the rock could symbolize taking a courageous leap into the exploration of your partner's family past. Finding the old skeleton key on the rock suggests that this journey will lead to the discovery of something valuable and potentially life-changing.\n\nWhen your three-year-old son appears, he becomes the guide for your exploration. His presence may symbolize innocence, intuition, or a connection to a higher power. Following him leads you to an old townhouse and later to the row of cottages, which signifies getting closer to discovering your partner's family roots.\n\nEncountering the old lady's sitting room and finding your ex's brother's birth certificate among her belongings suggests stumbling upon significant documents or records. The presence of the old Yorkshire dog may symbolize loyalty, protection, or a connection to the past.\n\nFinally, meeting your partner's father, who was previously believed to have been absent, suggests a surprise reunion or the resolution of unanswered questions. His initial anger may reflect unresolved issues or emotions tied to his absence. However, his act of picking up your son and celebrating his presence suggests a joyful reunion and the restoration of family bonds.\n\nOverall, this dream appears to convey a journey of discovery, connection, and resolution within your partner's family. It may also highlight the significance of intuition and the guidance of your child in finding important truths or reunions.",

            "dream": "Was in a huge cruise where they would go around the world and back to where we started. It was very fancy and I felt out of place. When asking someone for help, they avoided eye contacted and looked at me with disgust. The person seemed very rich and she seemed to not like me around. I wanted to leave but couldn't because it was in the middle of the trip.",

            "interpretation": "This dream may represent feelings of being out of place or uncomfortable in a new or unfamiliar environment. The cruise ship could represent a journey or adventure that you are on in your waking life. The feeling of being looked down upon or avoided by someone on the trip may indicate feelings of insecurity or inferiority. It could be helpful to evaluate whether these feelings are based on reality or if they stem from your own self-doubt. Additionally, feeling trapped or unable to leave could point to a sense of being stuck in a situation in your waking life. Consider examining any current situations or relationships that may be making you feel this way and focus on making positive changes to improve your confidence and self-worth.",

            "interpretation": "Running away from something or someone that wants to hurt you in a dream can represent feelings of stress, anxiety or fear in your waking life. The fact that this thing is always in the sky or feels like it's everywhere watching you might indicate that you feel like you\u2019re being constantly watched or judged by someone or something. The desire to hurt you and make you suffer could represent your own negative self-talk or self-sabotaging behavior, or it could be a manifestation of external pressures that are causing you pain. The dream may be a reflection of your subconscious desire to escape from these pressures and find a way to protect yourself from harm. Consider identifying any sources of stress and anxiety in your waking life and seeking ways to mitigate or eliminate them.",
