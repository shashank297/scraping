            "interpretation": "The dream may suggest a feeling of being out of control or helpless in a situation where you might desire to have more power or influence. The presence of the social media influencer who is now in a wheelchair could symbolize a belief that you or someone you know who once held great power or influence is now weakened or more vulnerable. The fact that they are now dating the friend of your ex-partner might suggest a feeling of betrayal or jealousy in your personal relationships. Being at their compound for a number of days in the dream could represent spending a significant amount of time in this situation or feeling trapped or stuck in a certain place or circumstance. Overall, this dream may indicate a need to examine your feelings about power, influence, personal relationships, and a lack of control in your life.",

The twins can represent duality or the idea of two opposing forces coming together. The black woman may represent a strong, nurturing presence in your life or someone who has qualities that you admire and want to emulate. \n\nOverall, this dream may be pointing towards the need for you to seek more support and balance in your life, while also incorporating qualities that you admire in others.",

            "interpretation": "Your dream may be related to some kind of struggle or conflict you are experiencing in your waking life. The monsters and invasion can represent a fear of outside influences that are beyond your control, or people or situations that you perceive as threatening. Being punished for attempted escapes suggests you may feel trapped in your current situation and are struggling to break free.\n\nThe realization that you had been in this situation before may indicate that you feel stuck in a repetitive cycle in your life, or that you are facing similar challenges and feeling powerless to change them. The safe house could represent a place of refuge or a sense of safety, while the familiar people and storylines from previous dreams may represent patterns that you have seen before.\n\nMeeting the man you liked better than before may suggest that you are reevaluating your relationships or desires, and that your feelings towards someone may have changed over time. The attack on the safe house and the ensuing battle may represent a struggle to maintain a sense of security and control in the face of external pressures.\n\nOverall, the dream may be indicating a need to confront difficult situations in your waking life and find ways to overcome them, even if you feel powerless at times. It may also suggest a need to break free from repetitive patterns and find new ways of approaching challenges or relationships.",

            "dream": "Me and my sister Tegan were in an old kitchen, and our dead grandmother was there. I just remember seeing her and then me and Tegan were walking down Dawson Parade towards Kmart. I stopped halfway down and suddenly got a really awful feeling as I stared down the street. I knew I had to turn back around for some reason and I was trying to explain my broken reasoning to Tegan. I don\u2019t remember what she said but I immediately crossed the street and made my way back, except my feet felt heavy and it was fast becoming more and more difficult to walk. Without looking back around, I knew someone (not Tegan) was behind me and about to grab me. I panicked but then I woke up. \n\nThen suddenly, I was lying in bed, definitely awake, but I couldn\u2019t move. I closed my eyes and I felt a marble-like hand slide delicately into mine. My eyes sprung open and a woman in white was sitting on the edge of my bed. I tried looking up to see her face but I wasn\u2019t able to. All of this lasted only a second and she disappeared. But when I turned my head in the dark to the left, I saw an outline of a woman\u2019s face flash in the darkness. It flashed once, twice and finally faded into the wall. I was awake when this happened. I know this because I didn\u2019t go back to sleep\u2026\n",

            "interpretation": "The dream you had about your grandmother and sister in an old kitchen could symbolize your desire to connect with your family's roots or past traditions. Your deceased grandmother's presence may represent guidance, wisdom, or love from beyond the grave. Walking towards Kmart may suggest consumerist values or a need for material gratification, but your sudden bad feeling and intuition to turn back around implies a discomfort with this direction and a desire to return to a more grounded or authentic path. The feeling of someone chasing you and trying to grab you could reflect a sense of danger or fear of being pursued, perhaps by external pressures or conflicting desires within yourself.\n\nThe second part of your dream involving the woman in white may represent a feeling of being visited by a spiritual presence or ghostly entity. The marble-like hand and face flashing in the darkness could suggest a sense of mystery, enchantment, or anxiety, as if you're experiencing something both otherworldly and familiar. Overall, these dreams may be encouraging you to trust your intuition, honor your past and identity, and stay alert to any unseen forces influencing your life.",
