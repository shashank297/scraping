The neighbour joins the conversation but his wife gives me a contemptuous look. She later on tidies my desk, but it makes it more messy. I decide to tidy it again and while plugging in a cable into my computer, the cable breaks and it makes weird electrical noises. I am afraid of getting electrocuted. ",

            "interpretation": "This dream could represent feelings of vulnerability and unease in your personal or professional life. Your work at home symbolizes a sense of productivity and personal focus. The open windows may suggest a desire for connection or being heard by others, specifically your noisy neighbors. \n\nThe friend speaking to you through the window indicates unexpected social interactions or communication from unexpected sources. The neighbor joining the conversation could represent a desire for involvement or intrusion in your personal or professional affairs. The wife's contemptuous look suggests feelings of judgment or disapproval from someone close to you.\n\nThe tidying of your desk by the wife could symbolize attempts to control or manage your work environment, but it ultimately results in more chaos or disorganization. This may reflect feelings of frustration or ineffectiveness in handling your responsibilities or daily tasks.\n\nThe broken cable and electrical noises when plugging it in may represent a fear of potential disruptions or mishaps in your work or personal life. The fear of getting electrocuted suggests a fear of negative consequences or harm associated with your endeavors.\n\nOverall, this dream could signify a need for better boundaries, effective communication, and a sense of control in your personal and professional relationships.

            "interpretation": "Dreams are complex and personal, so their meanings can vary depending on the individual. However, I can provide you with some general interpretations of the symbols within your dream:\n\nTrapeze Americano: Trapeze typically symbolizes taking risks, freedom, and the ability to navigate through life's challenges. Performing trapeze Americano could suggest that you are going through a period of taking daring risks or trying to find balance and excitement in your life.\n\nMassive shit turd rolling towards you: Excrement or feces often represents unwanted or negative emotions, experiences, or aspects of yourself that you need to release or let go of. The fact that the turd is massive and rolling towards you could indicate that you feel overwhelmed or burdened by something in your waking life. It may be a representation of something you are afraid of or something that is causing you anxiety or discomfort.\n\nJumping and landing in a cake (chocolate): Jumping in dreams can signify a desire to escape or avoid a situation, while cake traditionally represents celebrations, rewards, or indulgence. The fact that you land in a cake, specifically chocolate, suggests that you are trying to find comfort or escape from a difficult situation by indulging in something pleasurable or rewarding.\n\nOverall, this dream could indicate that you are currently facing challenges or fears in your life that you are trying to navigate and escape from. It may also suggest a desire to find solace or reward yourself amidst these difficulties.

            "interpretation": "This dream may symbolize several aspects of your personal life and emotions. The clone soldier represents a sense of duty and responsibility in your waking life. Hunting down boars on another planet indicates that you are facing challenges or conflicts that may seem overwhelming, fierce, or difficult to conquer.\n\nThe fact that these boars can turn into humans suggests that these challenges may involve deception or hidden motives from people around you. It may be a sign that you are wary of trusting others fully.\n\nThe planet where your boyfriend lives signifies a place of emotional connection or familiarity to you. The presence of your boyfriend in the dream indicates a desire for support and assistance in navigating these challenges. His involvement with the pig leaders through sex as a means of gaining information suggests that you may feel that others are compromising their integrity or using unorthodox methods to achieve their goals.\n\nThe chase scene and the act of saving a wounded kitten symbolize your compassion and ability to protect and care for others, even in the face of danger. Your successful killing of the boar demonstrates your ability to overcome these challenges and eliminate the threats they pose.\n\nThe transformation of the boar into a black, smelly, mushy pile of coal suggests that once you confront and defeat these challenges, they will no longer have power over you. It also signifies the purification or transformation of negative or harmful energies into something less harmful or more manageable.\n\nOverall, this dream indicates that you are facing formidable challenges that may involve deception and manipulation. However, with the support of loved ones and by relying on your inner strength and compassion, you will be able to overcome these obstacles and transform them into something more manageable.",

Nostalgia and Lost Connections: The first part of the dream, where you find a pouch of Lalaloopsies from your childhood, represents nostalgia and rediscovering lost connections. It may suggest that you are exploring your past and reminiscing about simpler times.\n\n2. Fear and Uncertainty: The second part of the dream, where you encounter a pandemic in a foreign country, reflects a sense of fear and uncertainty. The epidemic and the inability to find help represent feelings of vulnerability and being overwhelmed by forces beyond your control.\n\n3. Inner Strength and Adaptability: The gorilla and the coyote that join your party can symbolize the challenges and obstacles in your life. Despite the initial fear and chaos they cause, you discover that they are friendly and allow you to pet them. This may suggest that even in difficult situations, you have the ability to adapt and find a way to handle challenges.\n\n4. Trust and Betrayal: The actions of the old woman and your dog are significant. The old woman going into the bushes despite being warned symbolizes a lack of trust or rational decision-making. Meanwhile, your dog following her implies loyalty and protection. Your dad scolding you for disobeying the guide, and subsequently apologizing, highlights the theme of trust and potential betrayal within familial relationships.\n\nOverall, the dream may reflect your desire for connection, the need to navigate an uncertain situation, and the importance of trust and adaptability in overcoming challenges. It may also indicate unresolved emotions from the past and the need to address them in order to move forward.",

Disruption of order or norms: This dream could symbolize a desire to challenge societal norms or expectations. It may indicate a need to break free from conventional constraints in order to express yourself more genuinely. However, it is essential to consider the consequences and potential impact on others when exploring alternative paths.\n\n2. Repressed emotions: Defecating in a dream can often symbolize the release of repressed emotions or letting go of negativity. The cake, which is typically associated with celebrations, could represent an aspect of your life that you feel conflicted about or wish to discard. This dream may suggest a need to address unresolved emotions or to find healthier ways to cope with stress or negative feelings.\n\n3. Lack of control or consequences: Dreaming about doing something inappropriate or taboo, like defecating in an improper place, may reflect a sense of losing control or fear of facing the consequences of your actions. It could serve as a reminder to be cautious and intentional about your choices and behaviors.\n\nIt's important to remember that dream interpretations are subjective, and the true meaning can only be determined by the dreamer.

            "interpretation": "Dreams can have various interpretations based on personal experiences and emotions. Generally, mirrors symbolize self-reflection and how we perceive ourselves. Vomiting or throwing up often represents the need to release or get rid of something that is causing distress or discomfort.\n\nIn this dream, the black and white liquid could represent conflicting emotions or thoughts. Black often symbolizes negative emotions such as fear, sadness, or darkness, while white represents purity, clarity, or innocence. The combination of these two contrasting liquids suggests a mix of positive and negative aspects within you.\n\nThis dream might indicate that you are going through a period of self-reflection and confronting conflicting emotions or thoughts. It could be a sign that you are recognizing and purging negative aspects within yourself, trying to find balance, or seeking a clearer understanding of your emotions.\n\nConsider reflecting on any recent events or personal circumstances that might relate to this dream. Exploring your inner conflicts and emotions can help you understand the underlying message and guide you towards personal growth or resolution.",

Every time in my dream, once I had realised it, I became dreadfully scared of someone bad entering our home. I ran to the door and when I was trying to close it, something was wrong with the lock: one time it was simply broken, another time it was actually a door handle that came out of the door once I pulled it. And these dream often involved someone standing behind the door (I could see them in the peephole), so I had to try to lock the door without letting them know of my presence. In most cases I failed, and the person on the other side of the door pulled it, I became terrified, and the dream ended.\nWhat is the meaning of this dream? Why it was reoccurring?",

As a child, you may have experienced situations or events that made you feel unsafe or exposed, which is why this dream reoccurred.\n\nThe open door symbolizes an opportunity for negative influences or harmful situations to enter your life. Your fear and urgency to close the door emphasize your desire to protect yourself and maintain a sense of security. The recurring theme of the broken lock or door handle suggests that you feel powerless and unable to effectively defend yourself against potential threats.\n\nThe person standing behind the door represents the unknown and the fear of the consequences that may arise if you fail to secure your boundaries. This individual symbolizes the potential harm that could come from allowing external influences into your personal space, which further amplifies your fear.\n\nThe inability to successfully lock the door and the subsequent terror you experience in the dream reflects your anxieties about the potential consequences of failing to protect yourself from negative external forces. This recurring dream may indicate a need for a stronger sense of security, control, and boundaries in your waking life.\n\nIt could be beneficial to reflect on any current or past situations where you feel vulnerable, exposed, or lacking control. By identifying and addressing these concerns, you can work towards creating a greater sense of security and empowerment in your waking life, which may help reduce the occurrence of this dream.",

            "dream": "I was part of a vampire coven in my hometown.  We weren't big or powerful, but we were family, and we didn\u2019t usually feed on human blood but used animal blood instead, mostly livestock.  There was me, another older woman called Annie, and a man called Tony who was our leader.  We all lived together in a cosy set of rooms hollowed out from caves under the town hall.  There was a hidden entrance to our caves in the old prisoner's cells in the basement of the town hall.\nA few years after I became a vampire, we found a new vampire called Matt who had been experimenting with what his powers could do, but Tony asked him to slow down with trying things out when he came to live with our coven, to make sure he wouldn't get into any danger.  He complied but wasn't happy about it.\nWe went to a few town meetings about various unimportant things, and after a few months, we met another vampire called Anthony there.  He was very confident and we weren't sure how long he'd been a vampire or where he'd come from, but he was happy to join our coven and had a grasp of basic things he could do as a vampire.\nWhen Anthony joined the coven, he started to suggest that we should be exercising our powers more to keep our human town in check, and he thought we should feed on the humans more, which would make us stronger.  His suggestions started subtle and got progressively more obvious, but Tony turned down only some of them, such as the ones that said humans were lesser than vampires.  Throughout this, Matt was increasingly more upset and anti-social, because Tony was listening to Anthony's ideas but had turned down Matt when he presented similar ideas.\nI decided to talk to Tony about the problem since Matt refused to.  I described the problem from different angles and Tony realised what he'd been doing, and said he felt really bad about it.  He mentioned a prophecy detailing how vampires could take their place among humans in the open and suggested that Matt could be the one to fulfil the prophecy.  Tony went to fetch Matt so we could discuss it.\nWhile he was gone, my mind wandered and I started to look around the room a bit, and I climbed the rough-hewn walls of the room, trying to get comfortable.  I found a spot about halfway up the wall and settled into a nook, sitting upside down.  Tony and Matt returned and looked up at me with shock, wondering how I'd gotten up there.  I explained that it was no hassle really, the walls were pretty easy to climb.  Tony pointed out that he had carefully sanded the walls down to be smooth.  I took a closer look and realised the walls were very smooth, but I had climbed them anyway.  Tony listed this, among some other vampiric stuff I'd only seen myself do, and realised that I must be the person in the prophecy, not Matt.  He asked me how I became a vampire.\nI had a flashback to going deep-sea diving with someone else who I didn't know well.  I think we had become friends while on holiday.  There was a problem with my equipment and I was about to run out of air, but we were too far down to surface in time.  My diving partner said there was a way to stop me from dying, and asked if I trusted her.  I said yes, and she had bitten my neck before I could react, but I remember this instant feeling of happiness.  I woke up just after she bit me.",

The dreamer appears to belong to a group that has some sort of shared identity, as illustrated through the vampire coven. This group is presented as very familial and connected, which might reflect the dreamer's need to belong and find acceptance.\n\nThe introduction of new members and their differing beliefs illustrates how external influences can impact a group or individual. The conflict that arises between Matt and the other vampires highlights how easily affected people can be by others' ideas. The dreamer is the only one who steps in to try to solve the problem, which might show the dreamer's sense of responsibility to their group.\n\nThe dreamer's climbing of the walls could represent a desire for independence and the ability to choose one's own path. The walls being smooth, yet still climbable, could suggest that the dreamer is able to overcome obstacles and find a way forward despite the challenges. The fact that Tony, the leader, realizes that the dreamer is the chosen one in the prophecy indicates that the dreamer has unique abilities and individual strengths that set them apart from the rest of the group.\n\nLastly, the diving experience suggests that the dreamer has a sense of adventure and willingness to try new things, even at great risk. The feeling of happiness despite being bitten might also indicate a desire to find pleasure and fulfillment in life, even if it means taking a risk or stepping outside of one's comfort zone. Overall, the dream suggests that the dreamer is aware of power dynamics and the consequences of being influenced by others, but also has a strong sense of independence and an adventurous spirit.",

Generally, dreams about death are not literal and often symbolize a significant change or transition that is happening in your life.\n\nIn this dream, your girlfriend finding you dead may represent you feeling like you are not being your true self in your relationship. It can also suggest that you are feeling overwhelmed by something in your life and may be looking for an escape.\n\nThe overdose could also be symbolic. Perhaps you are over-indulging in something in your life, whether it be food, alcohol, or other substances. The dream may be a warning to pay more attention to your health and well-being.\n\nThis dream could also point towards unresolved emotions. It is important to remember that dreams are not always literal and their meaning can vary greatly based on your personal experiences and emotions. Consider reflecting on how you felt during the dream and what events in your waking life may be triggering these feelings.",
