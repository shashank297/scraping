            "interpretation": "Dreams involving death can often be unsettling, but it's important to remember that the meaning behind dream symbols can vary from person to person. In general, dreaming of someone who is dead but whom you didn't know could reflect feelings of uncertainty or a sense of detachment in your waking life. It might suggest that you are dealing with unfamiliar situations or people, causing you to feel somewhat overwhelmed or disconnected.\n\nOn a deeper level, this dream could also signify the need to address unresolved emotions or aspects of yourself that have been neglected or overlooked. It could be an invitation to explore your own fears or anxieties surrounding the unknown or unfamiliar.\n\nIt's important to consider the emotions evoked in the dream and any other connected symbols or events that occurred. This will give a more complete understanding of what the dream might mean for you personally.",

            "interpretation": "Dreaming of being taken by the waves in the ocean can have multiple interpretations, as dream symbolism is subjective and can vary based on an individual's personal experiences and emotions. Here are a few possible interpretations:\n\n1. Emotional overwhelm: Being taken by the waves may reflect a feeling of being overwhelmed or consumed by your emotions. It suggests that you may be going through a challenging time in your waking life that is causing a sense of powerlessness or a struggle to keep your emotions in check.\n\n2. Lack of control: The dream might signify a fear of losing control over aspects of your life. The powerful force of the waves taking you away may indicate that you feel like you are being swept away and lacking control over your circumstances or decisions.\n\n3. Surrender or acceptance: Alternatively, being taken by the waves could represent a sense of surrender or acceptance. It can imply that you are learning to let go and allow life to carry you forward, trusting the natural flow of events instead of constantly trying to resist or control them.\n\n4. Transformation: Waves are often associated with change and transformation, as they represent the ebb and flow of life. Being taken by the waves could symbolize that you are going through or about to go through a significant period of transformation or growth, where you will be forced to adapt to new circumstances or let go of old patterns.\n\nTo gain a clearer understanding of this dream's meaning, consider your current life situation, any emotions you may be experiencing, and any specific events or challenges you are facing. This context can help you interpret the dream more accurately and discover its personal significance for you.",

            "dream": "I had two children, one was older (grade 1, blonde hair, fair skinned) - the other was a baby (dark hair, dark skinned). The older child has the ability to see the future and also show me exactly what I was seeing. He saw the future of my baby or his little brother that he would always be afraid of the light. So he would be in his room in darkness playing video games or if the lights in the room were on, he would hide underneath the bed or somewhere dark. It was a sad future. My older kid thought he didn\u2019t want that for the baby so he killed the baby. I was devastated and I spent the rest of my dream panicking on how to get rid of the body.",

            "interpretation": "Dreams about children often represent new beginnings, growth, and innocent aspects of yourself. In this dream, the two children may symbolize parts of yourself or your life that are at different stages of development. The older child having the ability to see the future may represent your intuition or foresight in waking life.\n\nThe darker-skinned baby being afraid of the light may represent fear or discomfort with the unknown or unfamiliar. This could also symbolize a fear of change or taking risks. The older child's decision to kill the baby may represent a desire to protect or preserve what is known and familiar, even if it means sacrificing potential growth or progress.\n\nThis dream may be a reflection of your own fears in life, particularly around taking risks and stepping into the unknown. The panic around getting rid of the body may represent a sense of guilt or shame around letting go of old habits or beliefs. It may be helpful to examine areas of your life where you may be holding back and explore ways to overcome these fears and embrace new opportunities for growth.",

The dog resisting being carried could symbolize a resistance to change or a stubbornness that you or someone else may be exhibiting.\n\nThe presence of people outside the toilet could suggest that you feel like others are watching or judging you.
