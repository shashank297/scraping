            "interpretation": "Dreams about monsters devouring or eating the brain can symbolize feelings of being overwhelmed or consumed by fear, anxiety, or stress. It may suggest that you feel mentally drained or that your thoughts are being controlled or manipulated by negative forces or emotions.\n\nThis dream could be a reflection of an excessive amount of stress or pressure in your waking life, leading to a sense of powerlessness or loss of control over your thoughts and mental well-being. It could be a sign that you need to address and confront these fears or stressors in order to regain control and find peace of mind.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to evaluate if there are any external influences or people in your life that are causing these negative emotions or draining your mental energy. Consider seeking support or finding healthy coping mechanisms to alleviate these overwhelming feelings and regain a sense of mental stability.\n\nUltimately, the interpretation of a dream is subjective, and it is essential to reflect on your personal circumstances and emotions to derive the most accurate meaning.",

            "interpretation": "Dreams can have various interpretations and can be influenced by personal experiences and emotions. In this dream, it seems that the theme revolves around feelings of betrayal, insecurity, and perhaps fear of losing someone you care about. The formal attire and the restaurant overlooking the sea may symbolize a special or important occasion, highlighting the significance of the relationship. However, the sudden change in your girlfriend's behavior, including her laughing and being happy with another guy, suggests feelings of being left behind or replaced. This dream could reflect anxieties or insecurities about the strength and trust within your relationship. It's important to remember that dreams are subjective and can be influenced by individual emotions and personal circumstances, so ultimately only you can truly understand the true meaning and significance of this dream within your own life.",

            "interpretation": "Flying in a dream is often associated with a sense of freedom and liberation. In this dream, the feeling of flying with birds suggests a feeling of being unified or connected to nature.\n\nBirds are also associated with freedom, and their ability to fly represents a sense of overcoming limitations. Together, flying with birds suggests the dreamer feels free from something that was once holding them back, and they are now able to soar above it.\n\nIt could also represent a desire to escape from some kind of stress or responsibility in daily life by \"flying away\". The dream may be encouraging the dreamer to take some time to focus on self-care, explore their feelings of freedom and look for ways to let go of any burdens they\u2019re carrying.",

            "interpretation": "Dreams of snakes can have a variety of interpretations, depending on cultural and personal associations with snakes. Generally, black snakes can represent fear, negativity, or potential danger. The fact that they attacked you in the dream may indicate that you are feeling threatened or vulnerable in waking life. \n\nOne possible interpretation is that the dream is a representation of your own internal fears or anxieties. You may feel overwhelmed by negative thoughts or emotions, and the snakes may be a symbol of these internal struggles. Alternatively, the dream may be related to an external situation or relationship that is causing you stress or anxiety. The black snakes could represent a particular person or situation that feels threatening or hostile to you.\n\nIt's important to note that dreams are highly personal and subjective, and the best interpretation will depend on your own unique circumstances and experiences. Overall, the dream suggests that you may be feeling vulnerable or threatened in some aspect of your waking life, and it may be a sign that you need to address these concerns to alleviate some of the anxiety or fear you are experiencing.",
