The dreamer may feel a mix of emotions associated with the past, present, and future, as the dream blurs the temporal boundaries and challenges the linear perception of time.\n\nNote: While deja vu dreams can be intriguing and potentially hold personal significance, it is essential to approach their interpretation subjectively, considering the unique experiences and perspectives of the dreamer.
