This lady next to me said not to say that too loud because then everyone would get the idea and it would become full. apparently this lady was my long lost mother, and my mom wasn\u2019t my actual mom, the lady next to me was. and apparently i also had 14 siblings.\n\neveryone sitting on the bleachers got up suddenly, including me and went to leave the beach because they wanted to go to the graveyard thing. the exit to the beach had this like arc that said the name of it and it was made of like branches. \n\nthe scene changed again, and this time i was at my school with my 14 siblings, waiting for our mom to come with the car so we could go to this graveyard funhouse thing. all of my other siblings scattered to do their own thing and i stuck with one of my brothers and younger sister and one of her friends. we all wandered around the school for while, waiting for the car. at one point we saw a car and thought it was ours. but turns out it wasn\u2019t.", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 881583, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/a5c53a52-d041-4348-bca9-5c78cc3f2360.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234816Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=2defe5996e89e8b9e6a1b042da6bca61aaab28816dfa6dc90b5c403a96dba539", "interpretation": "This dream seems to be a compilation of various themes and elements, which can make interpretation challenging.

This theme continues as you spend time with the girl in the backyard and explore the house together.

Tigers: The presence of fighting tigers represents conflict or tension, possibly within yourself or in your relationships. The fact that you and the girl were warned not to walk along the train tracks could suggest the need to avoid or address potentially dangerous or challenging situations.\n\n3. Exploring and Discovery: The dream's setting transitions to a modern house, a hello kitty themed library, and a cooking show-like room, all representing exploration and discovery.

The chase that ensues could symbolize a need to confront or overcome your fears or anxieties.\n\n6. Razor and Beach: The razor represents a tool for grooming and cleansing. Its presence at the beach, where you are confronted with massive waves and forceful energies, suggests a need for self-care and protection in the face of overwhelming emotions or challenges.\n\n7.
