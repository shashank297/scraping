Your dream may be reflecting feelings of nostalgia, longing, or even sadness for the loss of these friendships. The fact that you mention getting sick in the dreams could represent a correlation between the deterioration of the friendships and your own personal well-being.\n\nThe theme of trying to talk to your ex-best friends may imply a desire to reconnect or make amends, suggesting that you might still have unfinished feelings or unresolved conflicts related to these relationships. The moments when they appear mad or ditch you for someone else could reflect your fears of rejection or abandonment, which may stem from the experiences of losing their friendship when you got sick.\n\nThe mention of them having babies in the dreams could have various interpretations. It might symbolize the growth and change that has taken place in their lives since your falling-out. Alternatively, it could represent a sense of them moving on and starting new chapters without you, accentuating the feeling of being left behind.\n\nOverall, this dream may indicate that you are processing unresolved emotions related to the loss of these friendships and the impact it had on your life. It could be beneficial to explore these feelings during your waking hours, perhaps seeking closure or finding ways to heal from the past.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "98b6d394-5949-4323-a264-f836e98e3538", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "\"Lost Connections and New Beginnings: Revisiting Childhood Bonds in the Depths of Dreams\"", "user_id": 1008730}, {"country": "US", "date": "Sat, 16 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I am at dinner at my best friend's house woth his dad and my boyfriend.

However, I can offer you a possible interpretation for your dream:\n\nThis dream could reflect feelings of betrayal and distrust in your close relationships. Being at dinner with your best friend's dad and your boyfriend may represent the integration and blending of your social circles and personal life. However, discovering that they are cannibals in the dream may symbolize a fear of hidden, darker aspects within these individuals or within the relationships themselves.\n\nLeaving the house in the dream may indicate a desire to distance yourself from this unsettling revelation. However, your boyfriend returning to the house and sharing that he is now a cannibal could suggest feelings of shock, disappointment, or perhaps even feeling responsible for his choices. This part of the dream may represent concerns about changes in your relationship or someone close to you embracing behaviors or attitudes that you find morally objectionable.\n\nConsider analyzing the dynamics and trust within your relationships. Are there any concerns or issues that have been causing worry or discomfort?

A man and young woman sat at the end.  The man was dressed in fancy clothes and excitedly invited me to join them for dinner. But when I did he told me to sit on his lap. I did but he immediately grabbed my boobs. I squirmed but he enjoyed it. I was surprised nobody tried to do anything about it. Then he took me to his castle home through a dimensional portal. Everything was dark gray, with a few notes of red. The castle was under a permanent night sky, and gave off villain vibes. There I found out he was the prince of this castle. He told me to go shower in one room, and left. I followed him and found a huge outdoor shower under the castle with a million cameras and screens. I found out he liked to shower with a million cameras watching him. I asked why. He said he always wanted to see what goes on behind clothes doors, so he believed everyone should be able to see what goes on behind his. I thought he was crazy. A smokey hologram of his emaciated father the king kept emerging from the ground, trying to warn him about something, but he kept pushing it back down. A message kept trying to play on one of the million screens, but he kept ignoring it. I thought about going back through the portal.  Monsters started to appear. Finally the king's hologram emerged, warning us that monsters were invading the castle! The message on screen played, warning us that the castle was being taken, and to escape! We escaped back through the dimensional portal, that apparently he needed my powers to create. Once we were on the other side, I was a warrior who's destiny was to destroy a pearl that a dragon loved. The dragon was dark purple and fierce, only a little larger than me. He lived in the remote misty mountain peaks peppered by lush trees and gorgeous sunrise views. We found on an ancient mountain shrine, a circle paved with sacred stones. I was a lean but uniquely talented warrior with jet black hair down to my chin. Despite the fight, sad music played in the background. I finally wrested the pearl from the dragon, and was about to destroy it, but he tried to stop me. The pearl erupted in light, dousing us all in light and shadow, as my sword swung towards the final blow and the dragon closed in. The dream ended before I saw what happened.

As a dream interpreter, I will provide you with a general analysis of the dream, keeping in mind that personal associations and emotions related to specific symbols may vary.\n\nThe dream starts with you stumbling upon a fancy dinner. This could symbolize a desire for luxury or a sense of social acceptance. The man and young woman at the table represent elements of authority or influence. However, the man's inappropriate behavior towards you suggests an abusive or manipulative dynamic. It may symbolize feeling taken advantage of or disrespected in a particular situation. The lack of intervention from others could indicate feelings of isolation or powerlessness.\n\nThe transition to the castle through a dimensional portal suggests a shift into a different reality or mindset. The dark and villainous atmosphere of the castle could represent hidden fears, suppressed emotions, or a sense of being trapped in a negative situation. The prince's desire for everyone to see what goes on behind clothes doors could symbolize exhibitionism or a need for control over others.\n\nThe emergence of the smoky hologram of the emaciated father and the warning message on the screens indicates unresolved issues or ignored warnings. This could suggest that there are important messages or insights being disregarded in waking life.\n\nThe appearance of monsters invading the castle signifies threats or challenges that you may be facing. The hologram's desperate warning and the message on screen emphasize the imminent danger and need to escape. This could symbolize the need to take action, face your fears, or leave a toxic environment.\n\nAfter escaping back through the dimensional portal, you transform into a skilled warrior destined to destroy a pearl loved by a dragon. This could represent a personal struggle or spiritual journey where you have to confront powerful forces within yourself or overcome obstacles. The dragon may symbolize inner fears or desires that need to be acknowledged and challenged. The sad music playing in the background suggests a mix of emotions during this conflict.\n\nThe dream ends before revealing what happens after you retrieve the pearl but implies a climactic moment of light, shadow, and the impending sword strike. This suggests that there is a significant turning point or resolution approaching in your waking life, where you may need to make a difficult choice or confront the consequences of your actions.\n\nOverall, this dream could indicate feelings of being taken advantage of, trapped in a negative situation, facing imminent dangers, and undergoing a transformative journey. It suggests a need for self-reflection, taking action, and addressing unresolved issues in order to find resolution and growth.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "601dd842-99ee-43a3-b89d-fcd2ea29786a", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "\"The Enchanted Dinner, the Castle Portal, and the Battle of Shadows: A Warrior's Destiny\"", "user_id": 990215}, {"country": "US", "date": "Sat, 16 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "So from what I believe was the start of my dream, I left my home to go to a house party. When I arrived there, I began talking to two girls. Somehow, I joked about nobody wanting to get with me at the party. And then they said something like: \"Look at you, of course nobody would want you.\" I responded with a flurry of extremely disrespectful insults, which one of them brushed off. The fatter of the two looked disgusted, and went upstairs. I followed her up there sneakily, and saw her shut off the power to the house. Then, smoke began rising and everybody left. When I got home, I told my mom that I was home early because the party got shut down. Then, when I walked in everything became weird. I saw a weird yellow creature crawling around, which I informed my mom about. After that, I saw dozens of these weird creatures, and red ones began appearing too. I told my mom, but she acted confused and said she didn't see anything. After, I saw a car pull in the driveway with it's back-right wheel covered in these creatures. What was even stranger was that a garbage truck pulled into my kitchen, which was weird because it couldn't fit and just noclipped through the wall. My mom also didn't see this. I then thought I was going crazy, making me grab my things and walk out of the house. I began walking, and I saw a group that I thought I was familiar with, a group of serial killers. It was late at night, and they were killing somebody with hachets. I walked past them, and then they began running after me so I ran. I started getting tired, and got to a certain point in the road and got a \"speed boost,\" and my legs moved fast and weren't tired. Myself in my dream noticed this, and said it was where I always seemed to get one, although I don't know why now. I ran to the backyard of my house, where they continued to chase me. For a split-second, I saw a video-game style chat in my upper left corner. I was in third person now, but couldn't see myself.
