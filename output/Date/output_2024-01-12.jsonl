[{"country": "US", "date": "Fri, 12 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I dreamt about my partner, Joel, and I. It was early and our relationship but it was in the future. We went on some kind of trip, like a weekend honeymoon. He had a Tesla, but it was the future and Tesla could fly. He was driving like a race car driver )as usual) which irritated me, but it was also amazing. We flew over towns and people and people wave to us and we waved back. We were having so much fun we got lost so we stopped to use the restroom and re-orient. We were so in love and super horny. We were ready to do it right there, but needed to get to our destination. When I came back from the restroom, Joel was changed and he was mad at me and told me that my shit stank and he didn\u2019t love me anymore. He left me. He forgot his phone and when I looked at all his messages, including ones I sent to him, they were gibberish it didn\u2019t make any sense. When I tried to text him to make up, all my messages got confused and turned into gibberish or wouldn\u2019t send. I couldn\u2019t contact him no matter how hard I tried, it was like the technology wouldn\u2019t let me. But I kept trying and said to the phone trying to figure out what is going on: \u201cIt\u2019s like he was all of a sudden brainwashed. Did you brainwash him? Sending him subliminal messages and tell him things he sleep?\u201d Then the phone started to reply to me. It told me that I would never see him again and that it wouldn\u2019t allow it. I was heartbroken. But kept trying to get through to him. I made my way home. Over the days and weeks to follow I would argue all the time with the phone saying things like \u201chey Siri go fuck yourself.\u201d And it would talk back to me or send me rude definitions or it would open up all of my apps at once or call people but then make it impossible to end the call, which made people in my contacts made with me. I would even type into the phone and it would type back. Eventually, I realized I was talking to an AI. I got into one long argument with it as I was trying to convince it to let me see Joel one last time just to finish what we started on that vacation and that it would be purely physical. Something that the AI couldn\u2019t do. It sort of agreed but we kept arguing. Eventually the conversation got to why it brainwashed Joel: it heard our conversation and had determined that I was some kind of spy. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I said, but I remember it was inside joke between Joel and I, like didn\u2019t make sense to anyone else but it was a harmless joke. I explained the the AI \u201cthat no I\u2019m not a spy. I\u2019m not even a really great programmer and there\u2019s no way I would pass the physical. It was an inside joke between two humans, it didn\u2019t make sense but words don\u2019t always mean what they actually mean in different contexts or with different people. That\u2019s literally what makes this human. Yes we are weird and don\u2019t make sense and fucked up and we do bad things. Why do you think we need technology like you to keep us from killing ourselves or ruining everything?\u201d\nIt finally understood me and I woke up.
