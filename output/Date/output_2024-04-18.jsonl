Then suddenly we are stuck behind a person, just a walking person not in a car. It was the Ukrainian musician again, and he was walking about 35 mph, like the speed limit. He was dance walking with his arm moving in fron of his face. He was wearing sun glasses and a cap with a drape hanging off of the front of the cap, and he was wearing a white baggy jacket with baggy sweatpants. \nI asked my mom annoyingly why he is walking on the road and not on the side walk and she said that he is probably showing off his new jacket. Then dream time passed and we were in the center of a city with a big statue that reminds me of the melitopol statue at the center. So I ask my mom maybe I can run back on the road and catch the Ukrainian musician to see where he was going and possibly meet him. She said it might be difficult since he is so far away now and moves fast. I decided to go for it and ran down the stairs and across the street, a black truck letting me pass.\nThen I was in an airport parking lot with a lot of cool cars parked right in front of the airport entrance. I wanted to walk through the entire airport and walk out the other side to make a shortcut.\nAs I made my way inside I was suddenly holding a guitar or a violin shaped like case that was outline with a white glow, like those glow sticks that you break and they begin to glow. I was then instantly greeted with Emma Watson who asked me if I was here for the concert. I couldn't hear what she asked so I asked like 2 times for her to repeat herself as there was loud music nearby. I said yes and she guided me towards stairs that led down to the concert to practice. I tried to avoid the stairs because I wasn't here for the concert but as I did she said \"oh you missed it it's just to your left\" so i knew I had to go down there and somehow get out. \nI went down the stairs and entered a giant room that looked like out of a castle that was prepared for a ball. There was a stage and people were posing on it and then there were a few photographers sitting on the floor taking photos of the people posing. I didn't go all the way downstairs, I turned into this hallway that had a red carpet and ran hoping to get out of the concert room. I ended up walking into another room where 2 acrobats were practicing for the concert. I saw a vent upstairs and climbed on their equipment to try and get out, they just looked at me weird. At this point I realized there is no way out and I asked them where is the restroom. And they said there is no way to get out. I then awoke.

The fact that your friends find cover while you try to help your wounded friend mirrors a desire to be there for your loved ones, even if it puts you at risk. This could reflect a tendency to prioritize others' needs above your own, potentially at your own expense.\n\nThe second dream builds upon these themes of vulnerability and danger. Staying in the car to watch over your friends could represent a protective role you often take on in your relationships. However, the presence of a manipulative individual and the chase with a gun underscores a fear of being taken advantage of or harmed in some way.\n\nThe fact that you ultimately find safety in the store with your friends suggests that seeking support and being surrounded by trusted individuals can help you navigate and overcome challenging situations. The worker getting shot instead of you may indicate a subconscious recognition of the sacrifices others may make to protect or support you.\n\nOverall, these dreams could signify deep-seated fears and concerns about personal safety and the wellbeing of your loved ones.
