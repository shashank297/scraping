Actually I first see his absence my mother tells me suddenly that he\u2019s died and I\u2019m overwhelmed in absolute disbelief refusing to believe.

He says that he\u2019s not exactly my stepdad not but I tell him he looks exactly like my stepdad there\u2019s a weird ambiguity in there. Then I bring him towards my mother to prove that my stepdad is in fact not dead but my mother looks at him like a stranger like we\u2019re seeing two different people in our minds eye. Even my stepdad/not stepdad tells me he\u2019s just a good copy and I\u2019m fact is a different person. He tells me that if he showed his real form I\u2019d know that he wasn\u2019t the real stepdad. But I tell him not to because even if it\u2019s just a copy I can\u2019t bear to loose it either at least I\u2019d have that copy and delude myself a little bit. There\u2019s an ambiguity in the dream is he really my stepdad that\u2019s in fact not dead or is he just wearing the face of him and that my real stepdad is dead. In any case in the dream I\u2019m unable to confront it.

The initial shock and disbelief upon hearing of his death suggests that you cannot fathom a world without him and are unwilling to accept his absence. Holding his pillow against you symbolizes your desire for comfort and connection with him.\n\nThe appearance of your stepdad in the dream brings a sense of relief, but the ambiguity surrounding his identity reflects your subconscious uncertainty. The gold cross he gives you represents the bond and love you have for each other. However, his claim of not being exactly your stepdad signifies a deeper sense of doubt or alteration in the relationship. This could represent your fear that he might change or be replaced in some way.\n\nWhen you bring him to your mother to prove he is alive, her reaction as if he is a stranger suggests that she may not share the same perception of him as you do. This disconnect between your perspectives further highlights the confusion and uncertainty surrounding his identity.\n\nThe dream also explores the idea of accepting a copy or illusion of your stepdad, even though you understand it's not the real person. This portrays your inner struggle between wanting to hold onto any semblance of him, even if it's not genuine, and the fear of facing the truth and the pain that may come with it.\n\nOverall, this dream reflects your deep love for your stepdad and the fear of losing him. It suggests that you may be grappling with the idea of his mortality and the potential changes in your relationship. It may be a reflection of your subconscious processing these emotions and your desire to hold onto the memories and connection you share.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "5544a226-e7a7-4178-8d33-b0f3c936ae82", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": null, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "The Illusion of Familiarity: The Ambiguous Presence of My Stepdad in a Dream", "user_id": 944029}, {"country": "TR", "date": "Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "Dear chat the other day a week ago, I had another dream where I was at a ski resort hotel and I was going to play backgammon in the common room with the fireplace.

Then the elevator did not stop at the ground zero and didn\u2019t let me get off, instead the elevator came out of its place and took the stairs down to minus -2.  And then it opened the doprs and let me out. I was fine and a bit flabbergasted. And 2 friends were like are you okay?

It's important to remember that dream interpretations are subjective and can vary depending on the individual's personal experiences and emotions. Here are a few possible explanations for this dream scenario:\n\n1. Nostalgia and Remembering Deceased Friends: The presence of Manabu and Jack, both deceased individuals, suggests that this dream may be a reflection of your longing to reconnect with or remember loved ones who have passed away. It could be a symbolic representation of the impact they had on your life and the importance of their presence.\n\n2. Seeking Support and Comfort: The hospital lobby setting may symbolize a need for emotional support and healing. You and your husband, along with the deceased friends, being seated and joined together on a bench could indicate a desire for companionship during a difficult time. The presence of Jack, who appears younger and more fit, might represent the idea of finding solace and rejuvenation through the memories or qualities associated with him.\n\n3. Reflection on Mortality and Aging: The mention of Jack potentially having a procedure in the hospital could reflect a contemplation of aging and mortality. Seeing Jack looking younger and more fit may symbolize a desire to preserve youthfulness or maintain vitality as one grows older. This could be a subconscious reflection on your own thoughts or concerns regarding aging and the passage of time.\n\nUltimately, the true meaning of this dream can only be determined by you, as the dreamer, taking into account your personal associations with the dream symbols and your current life circumstances.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "f3b4e438-d157-47ee-b4dc-0da088e76f6b", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "A Hospital Encounter: Reunited with Deceased Friends and Puzzling Transformations", "user_id": 906757}]
