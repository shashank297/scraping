I was visiting like a coffee shop/bar type of place or something with a counter/table that was oval shaped and empty in the middle. I was visiting a friend or someone and a girl worked at this place and she was inside the center oval thing working. I\u2019m not sure why, but I believe I visited this place multiple times to either help my friend or someone. I sort of took note of this girl, she was cute but this wasn\u2019t something I really paid too much attention to. The interactions were nice but seeming normal to me, like I was just there to do something for my friend. I visited the place several times I believe, each time for the same reason I think, I was there to help someone else with something/ bring them something. I believe the person I was \u201chelping\u201d was a guy and I think they worked there. I\u2019m not sure how long this went on. Then a new dream segment occurred, I was at a store/mall with a girl I think, and the girl said \u201coh it\u2019s Tara\u201d and we see Tara, and Tara was happy to see the girl/person that was with me, but then she said something to me that implied that she and Brandon never wanna see me again/don\u2019t like me, and I had a \u201cfair enough\u201d reaction, like I was perfectly fine with that. Me and the person I came to the store/mall with start walking out of the store later and I see Brandon as I\u2019m walking out, and he gives me a not so happy look, as if confirming what Tara just said despite not being there to hear it lol. That is all I remember, I think it ended right there. Then in the next dream segment, I ended up somehow playing a modded version of black ops 2 zombies town, where I had everything possible in the game. The map was way cooler and way more realistic, I had every single perk, I think there were 14 perks, likely not all real perks in the real game. I also had every single gun that was on the map, and you can switch guns and cycle through every single gun in your inventory. It was very cool, and I took note of this. And I believe I told my little brother. I believe the person I was playing with/that got me into that map was a different character than the friend I was helping, could have been the same person, I\u2019m not sure. And I think this game might\u2019ve been in VR. But I don\u2019t think I played the game for long. I believe right after the game segment ended, I was walking back into the coffee shop/place. And I came to bring my friend something, and I think somewhere in doing this, my friend had me play a prank/joke or something on the girl that worked in the center thing. Or maybe I was meant to bring something to her and I just made a joke about how I was giving her the gift or something. And then I told her I was joking. I\u2019m not sure exactly. But she also gave me something. And I had to do like a little art style thing to kinda of make my own gift she gave me. And by the end, a picture was supposed to come out. She told me to hold the two sheets together until later on to give it some time to develope. And then she says \u201cHey Mark, I know you were joking and all, but\u2026 \u201c I didn\u2019t see this coming up until now but I knew she was about to ask me on a date. And she did. I was already very glad to say yes, but had to wait and not make it so obvious lol. She seemed very happy to ask and that I said yes. She left the coffee shop/place we were in, and I went to wait in a different lobby or something. Up until this point, there were very little characters in the dream, only the ones that played an actual role were in it/noticed in it. But in the lobby/area I was in now, I go to sit and there a lot of people, a lot of background noise too. And I sit in this chair near the front of the place, and look outside. And I start thinking about things, and I can just feel as if alot of people in the place are staring at me or paying attention to me for some reason. But I didn\u2019t mind/care what they thought, also this wasn\u2019t certain that they were paying attention to me, that\u2019s just how it felt, and I believe I took note of that idea too. Inside it\u2019s very bright and the mood is happy. But outside it was like raining and dark. The inside is separated from the outside by a glass cube kind of front facing structure. And it looked cool, and the thought I had was  that \u201crooms are like little pocket dimensions in a way\u201d, I guess I thought this because we created them, if we didn\u2019t we would be dealing with what\u2019s outside, but we fabricated/brought in this space/pocket that you can be safe from the outer world in. How if this room wasn\u2019t here, we would be in a field dealing with the rain. And i think like right after I have this thought, I either see my old English teacher mr.looker or he said hi to me. And I ask him \u201chow have you been Mr. Loomer?\u201d And he responds \u201cnot great\u201d and he tells me about how he has to live with like in in-laws or someone, someone that he has to deal with that\u2019s limiting him/not letting him do things, and he yells \u201cAND WOULD IT KILL THEM TO LET ME DRINK SOME WATER!!?\u201d implying they\u2019re not letting him drink enough water. And I relate to this in a way because I feel like I haven\u2019t been drinking enough water lately, so I empathize with the feeling of feeling dehydrated. Then I think about that girl and how she really did seem to have an interest in me, since I hadn\u2019t even really thought about her in that way but she went right out to ask me on a date, and seemed very glad to do so. So I was wondering, what about me attracted her, what made her like me? then I woke up right after that. I was feeling dehydrated, and suddenly realizing this was a dream, but it felt so real. I was so convinced it was real life. And I was disappointed because there was no girl I was going on a date with, and I also was disappointed that I never actually talked to Mr.Loomer . For some reason that kinda hit me too. While I was typing this, I had to really go take a poop, a common occurrence when I have these vivid dreams.

However, I can provide you with a general analysis.\n\nDriving around an area full of greenery and palm trees may represent a sense of freedom and relaxation. The presence of drug dealers could symbolize hidden desires or aspects of your personality that you may feel conflicted about. These men needing your assistance might suggest a need for assertiveness or the desire to be helpful in some way.\n\nThe skirmish with the three women could represent inner conflicts or disagreements in your waking life. The fact that two of them are average in appearance might signify ordinary challenges or difficulties, while the beautiful and bare-breasted woman with the gun may represent a more enticing or seductive temptation. This encounter with the gun-wielding woman may symbolize a confrontation with your own desires or passions.\n\nThe exchange of gunfire could suggest a struggle for power or control. The fact that both shots miss could imply a mutual fear or hesitation to fully engage in these desires.
