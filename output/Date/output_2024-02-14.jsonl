The shower in your dream symbolizes cleansing, renewal, and a fresh start. Being unable to find a shower indicates a desire for purification or release from stress and negativity.\n\nThe fact that all the showers were occupied could suggest that you feel overwhelmed or unable to find the time and space to take care of your own needs amidst your work commitments. The presence of Vicki, your administrator, who took out one of the showers, could suggest that external factors or demands from others are hindering your ability to take care of yourself.\n\nThis dream may represent a need for self-care and prioritizing your own well-being. It could be a reflection of feeling pressured by work-related responsibilities, leaving little time for personal rejuvenation. Consider finding ways to create a healthy work-life balance and make self-care a priority.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "fb3cfdbd-8872-4c34-8343-8307d3112603", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "\"The Elusive Shower: A Frustrating Quest at Work\"", "user_id": 969747}]
