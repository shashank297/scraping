I came to a covered bridge when I saw a huge wave. I told her a tsunami is coming and lost the call. After it passed, I got off the bridge and found my sister. More waves came. Each ok bigger than the last. We climbed coconut trees and held on. When we saw the big one coming she lost hope and started walking toward it. I grabbed her and we entered a building and started warning people. We couldn\u2019t find big trees so we found weeds to hold on to and said that we would make it if we held our breath and swam.

Walking and talking to your sister on the phone suggest a desire for support and guidance during this uncertain time. The covered bridge represents a transitional period in your life, and the huge wave or tsunami signifies a looming challenge or threat that you are aware of. Losing the call signifies a loss of connection or communication during times of crisis.\n\nThe successive waves that become bigger and more powerful could represent escalating obstacles or difficulties that you anticipate facing. Climbing coconut trees and holding on in the face of these waves suggests your determination and resilience to overcome challenges. However, your sister losing hope and walking towards the approaching wave might symbolize the temptation to give in to despair or surrender to the difficulties at hand.\n\nEntering a building and warning people demonstrates your urge to protect and help others in times of crisis. Your search for big trees but settling for weeds to hold on to may represent your ability to adapt and make the best of the resources available to you in challenging situations. Holding your breath and swimming indicate your determination to survive and persevere despite the overwhelming circumstances.\n\nOverall, this dream suggests that you are aware of impending challenges or obstacles in your life, but also highlights your resilience, adaptability, and willingness to help others through difficult times. It reflects your inner strength and determination to overcome any obstacles that come your way.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "e93419d2-2ddd-4738-99b5-cfdd5af4ad7a", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "Desperate Escape: Battling Tsunamis with Determination and Hope", "user_id": 937238}]
