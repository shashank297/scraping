The act of closing your eyes and enjoying the husky's affection suggests a sense of contentment and pleasure in connecting with these qualities. \n\nThe bar on top of the husky indicates a measure of success or progress, which was initially at 100 percent. This suggests that you were feeling confident and satisfied with your current state. However, the negative thought you had caused the bar to decrease, symbolizing a potential self-sabotaging tendency or a fear of ruining your own happiness.\n\nTaking a copy of the results of the bar and seeing some statistics on the back of the husky's neck could represent your inclination to analyze and evaluate your own actions and progress. This desire for self-reflection indicates a need for self-improvement and a desire to track your personal growth.\n\nYour sister's comment about your brilliant mind but doing stupid things could reflect how others perceive you or a fear of not living up to your full potential. It may suggest that you have unrecognized talents or intelligence but sometimes make poor choices.\n\nYour anger towards your sister and the mention of fixing her car again could represent feelings of being taken advantage of or unappreciated in your daily life. The conflict with your sister could be a manifestation of frustrations or resentments you are experiencing in your waking life.\n\nOverall, this dream appears to highlight a desire for freedom, self-improvement, and recognition of your own potential.

Before I knew it, there were like 10 of her family members, and they were all, including Janelle, in deep conversation with each other. All of the members of her family were super old geezers for some reason. They all seemed grouchy. And they were all conversing on my front porch acting like I wasn't there. I felt left out. I'd been a friend of Janelle for years! Anyway, finally one of the old geezers, I think her dad, yelled over to me rudely, \"Who's he?!?\" Janelle quickly and quietly said I was a friend. She shook my hand and very formally and quickly said goodbye. I think this part is very important because I can still feel that handshake. I can still feel her skin against mine. It made me happy. But the rest of the dream didn't seem happy. Ok, so then after the very short goodbye, I went inside my house and I have to assume that my crush and her family went back to theirs.", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 854855, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/4bbf187f-921d-4683-ac81-9e82f7c86eee.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234804Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=aaf7494cf1600b72032cf8450ceff6695c886b117972c2ec055533afe30a2290", "interpretation": "In this dream, the porch represents a place of connection and familiarity. Your presence on the porch indicates a desire to engage and connect with your crush, Janelle. Her being older and in college may symbolize feelings of being inferior or not on the same level as her.\n\nThe arrival of Janelle's family on the porch can suggest feelings of intrusion or being overshadowed. The fact that they seemed grouchy and engaged in deep conversations without acknowledging your presence may reflect a sense of being left out or not included in important aspects of Janelle's life.\n\nThe rude question from Janelle's father about your identity and Janelle's quick and formal goodbye could indicate potential feelings of rejection or not being fully accepted by her family. However, the handshake and the feeling it elicits suggest a brief moment of happiness and connection that you value.\n\nOverall, this dream may reflect your anxieties and insecurities about your relationship with Janelle, including concerns of not being fully integrated into her life or feeling inadequate compared to her. It could be helpful to communicate your feelings and concerns with Janelle in order to gain clarity and address any potential misunderstandings.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "16aa2ed1-52f7-4333-b728-d17c2ad074dd", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "\"Front Porch Reunion: A Bittersweet Encounter with Janelle and her Mysterious Geezer Family\"", "user_id": 1013931}, {"country": "CA", "date": "Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "saved ex-wife's father from a heart attacked while standing. performed CPR and he survived ", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 854756, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/aaec4bd5-0d95-40ed-a729-0a90ecd2475c.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234804Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=e4539e8e47f153b4efcdfe413c89168875ca63657ff8d7f7540a1388891aa54f", "interpretation": "Dreams can have various interpretations and can be influenced by personal experiences and emotions.
