She told me that I needed to watch this scene. I asked her to watch what and again my grandmother said I needed to watch the scene and pointed to the screen that appeared in the room. I walk towards the screen and have been sucked into what I am suppose to watch. Now, I am the character in the scene. The news on the TV in the living room of my home. I am on the catch with my mom and other family members. The news states there have been a rise in home invasions and to stay indoors and be careful. After the news I take a nap then is woken up by a knock on the door. My mom and I are very hesitant to answer the door but we reconginze a voice saying \"Keyajlyn (which is my sister) said they will be home but no one is answering but here's all these cars out here.\" Then another voice replied and said, \"Well you know Keyajlyn always pays for the shoes. We will text her and let her know that we tried to drop them off but we can't leave them here due to the home invasions. \" That's when I volunteered to go outside and pay for the shoes and quickly return inside. Mom agreed. So, I went outside and started speaking to the lady who had the shoes, but before I could say goodbye. My mom said \"Keyari (my name) watch out someone is trying to rob the house\" Next thing I know I hear gunshots and a man across the street with a gun in his right hand and carrying items from the house he just robbed in his left starting shooting at people who were outside. I got in between two cars that was parked in the drive and made my way underneath one car. But my sister arrived home and the man was coming up to our house trying to enter the home and he turned around and aimed the gun at my sister. I got out from underneath the car and ran in front of my sister and took the bullet. I started to slowly wake up but before I fully wake up. I had my partner telling to stay with him and don't die on him. Having my mom talking to the police and my sister in a state of shock. Then my grandma has come back and said that's enough that you need to see. And her last words to me were \"Be careful\" then I woke up with a pain in my chest just like I was recently shot.

Your willingness to go outside and pay for the shoes despite the home invasions indicates your sense of responsibility and desire to protect your family. However, the sudden threat of a robbery and the ensuing chaos reveal your underlying fears and anxieties about the safety of your loved ones.\n\nYour decision to step in front of your sister and take the bullet symbolizes your selflessness and willingness to sacrifice for those you care about.

When she arrived we all talked for a bit, but I went to the bathroom. When I came out, the lady was gone and my memory was wiped. I assumed the demon wiped my memory clean and that he was hiding the answers, a group of my old classmates went into the demon\u2019s house and tried to look for the answers in his drawers, but they were all locked. So, we stole his keys. We unlocked the drawer we wanted, but when we unlocked that drawer, all the drawers opened. We rummaged through all of them, but found no answers. While looking through the door, the demon came home and just stood behind us, observing almost curiously. At best, he was being lightly helpful, at worst he was just ambiguous. When he revealed no anger, I realized he either hadn\u2019t stolen my memory, his memory was wiped too, or he simply did not have the answers. The scene changed to me and the gang running on their old timey empty rollercoaster while the weather was dark, stormy, and rainy. We were booking it.

The presence of the demon, portrayed as angelically beautiful, indicates that you are not necessarily dealing with something inherently bad or negative. Rather, the demon symbolizes a challenge or obstacle you are facing that may seem daunting but has the potential to be beneficial in some way.\n\nThe tarot reader represents your intuition and subconscious mind, which you are reaching out to for assistance. However, the sudden disappearance of the tarot reader and the wiping of your memory suggest that you may feel a lack of control or uncertainty about the answers you are seeking. It seems that you suspect the demon, representing the challenge, may be intentionally hiding the answers from you.\n\nThe involvement of your old classmates in searching for the answers signifies a desire for connection and support from familiar people in your life. The locked drawers represent hidden aspects or secrets that you are trying to uncover. Stealing the demon's keys suggests a determination to gain access to the truth or solutions you seek.\n\nThe fact that all the drawers opened when you unlocked the desired one indicates that there may be multiple paths or possibilities to explore. However, despite going through all the drawers, you are still unable to find the answers you are looking for. This highlights the complexity of the situation and the need for further exploration.\n\nThe demon's return and his non-angry demeanor suggest that he may not be intentionally withholding the answers. It could imply that he, too, is searching for answers or resolution. This realization prompts you to reassess your perception of the demon and consider alternative explanations for the challenges you face.\n\nFinally, the scene of running on an old rollercoaster through dark and stormy weather reflects a sense of urgency and danger. It symbolizes that you are willing to take risks and face potential difficulties in pursuit of finding the answers or resolution you seek. Despite the possibility of failure or harm, the quest for answers takes priority for you.\n\nOverall, this dream indicates a strong desire for answers, a willingness to confront challenges, and a need for support and guidance from both familiar and unfamiliar sources.

I was on a car, Tesla ( which is weird because it's electric and I wouldn't buy one) in the car with me was a new trainee.  She was in her early 30's, a little heavy, blond hair, first job but it wasn't CFA. We stopped and walk to an open big garage in a residential area.\nAs we approach the area? This guy has antiques, small machinery for like for a man's garage etc.  Nothing organized, I have to search through it.  I find some pieces of furniture  and I show this trainee that I have a bottle of wood furniture cleaner. I then apply the cleaner to see how well it will clean up.Continue. 2\nThe guy shouts at me you testing my furniture again.   I holler back \"yep\", he smiles back at me\n  Then I ask him how much? I tell the trainee he's going to tell me a price that overpriced. $200 he says. And he did. Thanks then I left. As we left a bunch if guys came in kinda looking a bit rough.  The trainee asked should we call the cops. I smiled at her and said they are the cops. We drove around the neighborhood, saw a garage door 5 to a huge house and inside the garage were 5 Rolls Royce, different sizes. Also, it looked like the house heating water system was plumbed in the same rolls Royce metal and color. A burgundy red and cream color.\nContinue 3\nThen I pulled out onto the street started driving up a hill, and suddenly realized I wasn't driving forward, but going backwards down this steep hill. FAST I tried braking, nothing, I realized that the trainee was looking back and had put the car in reverse. I had her sit back down. I was then able to slow the car and bring it to a stop. At the house where the rolls royce cars were.  But the cars weren't in the garage nor driveway. An older woman  came out and asked if we were OK. I explained what happened and she invited me and the trainee in.  We sat in this garage which was amazing.  Then an older man came in with a team of young men baseball players. He said to the woman I said NO DISTRACTIONS.  Looking at me. She shrugged her shoulders and signaled him to move on. He said she will cost me points, I said I will pray for more points for you to win. I was sitting and he looked down at me like that will work? The older woman smiled.
