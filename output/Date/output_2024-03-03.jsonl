Even thought she didn't say it, I could tell she also missed me and that's why she called.\n\nI told her that I understand but I needed time to process how I feel. That I wasn't ready to just forgive them and move on and allow them back into my life.\n\nI remember thinking in my head about previous dreams I had, realizing they were premonitions of this moment. That she was meant to come back into my life but only when and IF I was ever ready.
