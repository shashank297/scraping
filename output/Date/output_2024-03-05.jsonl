The park symbolizes a space of joy and leisure, suggesting that you are seeking happiness and fulfillment in your waking life. The different activities and buildings within the park represent various aspects of your life and the different paths you have or could explore. \n\nThe presence of the building where you could adopt an animal suggests that you may be seeking a new source of love and companionship in your life. The white dogs that resemble your deceased dogs symbolize the memory and presence of these beloved pets in your life. Your calling out for your dog's name and not receiving a response may represent the inability to regain the same connection or find the same level of comfort and companionship you had with your previous pets.\n\nThe mention of Ellie as a potential alternative name could symbolize your willingness to adapt and open yourself up to new possibilities and connections. The brown poodle that resembles a Labradoodle may represent a potential new companion that you may have overlooked or not considered. \n\nThe ending of the dream, with the Humane Society stating that there were no more white dogs, may suggest that you need to explore other avenues or possibilities for finding companionship and love in your life.
