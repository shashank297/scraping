M mi dice \"c'\u00e8 da sempre\" e io invece gli rispondo \"no, mi ricordo che lo hanno costruito quando ero alle medie\". Qui dentro trovo S e mi metto a costruire un lego. \u00c8 una sorta di labirinto con le trappole e scelgo di fare un percorso insidioso e uno pi\u00f9 breve in cui per\u00f2 perdi subito una vita. E per accedere a questo c'\u00e8 la tipica porta ruotante dei lego con dietro lo scheletro (su cui perdo parecchio tempo a decidere che testa mettergli, se mettergli in mano qualcosa tipo una gamba, ma non ci sta in mano). Poi questo labirinto viene replicato nella realt\u00e0 e c'\u00e8 della gente che lo attraversa (immagino per gioco visto che c'era la questione delle vite), ma il risultato sembra un film d'azione low budget dove il protagonista fa un interpretazione falsissima di quanto sia straziato da questo percorso. Faccio per tornare a casa, ma nello shop di questo posto trovo un mio ex collega e gli dico \"ma \u00e8 vero che dal prossimo mese vi pagano solo 500 euro perch\u00e9 siete falliti?\" E lui \"no, spero di no\". Torno a casa e ci sono i miei ex capi che stanno nascondendo un sacco di impasto per la pasta dentro ai freezer. Quindi penso che effettivamente stanno tramando qualcosa (tipo pagare con il pane anzich\u00e9 coi soldi). Ci diciamo qualcosa e poi non ricordo altro.", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 802694, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/7b4da9d3-a8b2-412a-bcff-f026ad3e86eb.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234639Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=349a89fa2e4729188d5f4a16e89c48ce3545a82c4e610ce2bec4dde79f9e4332", "interpretation": "This dream appears to symbolize various aspects of your personal and professional life. The commercial area of your friend's town represents opportunities and growth. The modern complex replacing the supermarkets suggests newfound potential or advancements in your own life. The conversation between you and M about the construction of the complex reflects differing perspectives or memories. The presence of S and constructing a labyrinth with traps using LEGO may represent the challenges and choices you face in your life. The different paths and losing a life symbolize the risks and consequences of decision-making. The skeletal LEGO figure may indicate the need to confront fears or unresolved issues.\n\nThe replication of the labyrinth in reality with people crossing it suggests that you are observing others facing similar challenges or obstacles in their lives. The low budget action film with a poorly portrayed protagonist may symbolize feeling disconnected or misrepresented in your own struggles or emotions. This could reflect a sense of not being fully understood or acknowledged by those around you.\n\nEncountering your ex-colleague and discussing their financial situation suggests concerns about stability or monetary issues. The mention of receiving only 500 euros and the potential failure of their business may represent anxieties about financial security or the fear of unexpected changes. The discovery of your previous bosses hiding dough in freezers implies a sense of suspicion or mistrust. It may symbolize the belief that they are scheming or engaging in unethical practices, such as using alternative means of payment. The overall theme of the dream suggests a need for caution in your personal and professional relationships, as well as the importance of navigating challenges with careful consideration.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "ee79df66-6ae6-4a41-9f9e-bc0706b9c028", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": null, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "Skylines and Lego Mazes: A Journey Through a Modernized Hometown", "user_id": 934749}, {"country": "US", "date": "Tue, 30 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "In the dream all I knew was the world was ending.
