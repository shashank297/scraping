This could represent traits, desires, or emotions that you have not yet acknowledged or accepted. The fact that she is mute suggests a lack of communication or expression of these hidden aspects. \n\nFeeling baffled, shocked, scared, and disgusted signifies your emotional reaction to discovering these suppressed parts of yourself. It may imply a fear of being deceived or betrayed by someone close to you, as you mention being mad that she copied you and pretended to be you with your friends. This could indicate a fear of losing your individuality or being overshadowed by others. \n\nThe appearance of a huge crowd of plastic mannequins marching indicates artificiality and a sense of detachment. This could reflect your perception of the world around you, feeling like people are not genuine or are merely going through the motions without showing their true selves. \n\nThe realization that you are hallucinating these mannequins suggests a possible disconnect from reality or perhaps a questioning of what is real and what is not. This could mirror feelings of confusion or uncertainty in your waking life. Overall, your dream may be signaling a need to explore and integrate hidden aspects of yourself and to assess the authenticity of your relationships.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "6e2b9a2c-4e1f-4014-b6c4-90441eecba50", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": null, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "The Secret Sister: Discovering a Silent Doppelg\u00e4nger Amongst Plastic Hallucinations", "user_id": 959779}, {"country": "US", "date": "Fri, 02 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I got a call from someone in jail and they went from talkin in English to Spanish .

The call from someone in jail could represent a sense of being burdened or confined by someone or something. The transition from English to Spanish may suggest a feeling of confusion or difficulty in expressing yourself or understanding the situation.\n\nThe overheating and flaming phone could represent the mounting pressure and intensity of the situation. Your attempt to disconnect from it, but being unable to, may reflect a struggle to break free from the perceived constraints. The fact that the phone remained undamaged after being thrown suggests that despite the turmoil, you still have a sense of resilience and strength.\n\nThe appearance of your son's father in the dream, along with his attempts to come onto you, may symbolize unresolved issues or tensions from the past. Your rejection of him emphasizes your firm stance in not wanting to engage with him or be involved in anything related to the past.\n\nOverall, the dream seems to indicate a desire for freedom, independence, and protection of personal boundaries in challenging circumstances.
