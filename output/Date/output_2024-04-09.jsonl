Then all of a sudden there was a huge wave, maybe 20+ feet. And it crashed down on me and put me so far below the surface I was struggling to make it back up. I was slowly letting air out of my lungs trying to make it up. I had the realization that I wasn't able to breath under water but somehow I was able to stay submerged and not die. I did make it to the surface before another giant wave came and crashed down on me. It pulled me under and into its swirl.
