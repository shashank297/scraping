However, I can offer you a possible interpretation for your dream.\n\nThe presence of your deceased father in your dream may symbolize unresolved emotions or feelings related to his passing. It could represent a desire for connection or closure with him. Your father laying down on the couch and eventually dying may suggest that you are attempting to process and come to terms with his death.\n\nCalling the police and special units might indicate a search for support or guidance during this difficult time. However, feeling shocked that they didn't take care of your father's body suggests a feeling of being unprepared or overwhelmed by the responsibilities associated with his passing. This could reflect a need for assistance or a fear of facing the practical and emotional challenges that come with grief and loss.\n\nThe interaction with your brother and the decision to figure out what your father wanted you to do may reveal a desire for family unity and collaboration in honoring your father's memory. Wanting to consult your mother suggests a desire to involve her in the decision-making process and gather her perspective.\n\nLastly, the scene in the mall and your intention to buy candies for your father's wake could symbolize a need to commemorate your father's life and find comfort or solace in the midst of your grief. The act of choosing candies might represent a desire to remember the sweet and positive aspects of your father's life, rather than solely focusing on his passing.\n\nOverall, this dream could be a reflection of your desire for closure, support, and unity within your family as you navigate the emotions and practicalities associated with your father's death. It might be beneficial to explore these themes and feelings further in order to find peace and healing in your waking life.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "ba2ffdf8-b4fc-4050-9dd0-b7ef8e243cf0", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "Grieving Alone: A Shocking Visit from the Departed", "user_id": 827143}, {"country": "AU", "date": "Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "In my dream, I saw my mother, who is deceased, enter a florist shop.
