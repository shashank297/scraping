Your willingness to take a risk and wait for the outcome indicates that you trust your own judgment and are not easily influenced by others.\n\nThe dream suggests that your unique perspective and reasoning set you apart from the collective, and this is seen as a positive characteristic.

Then I went to get a drink or something else and when I slightly turned back and came back to my seat, I saw that my husband was flirting with another young girl and they were almost kissing. I was really disturbed and I asked him what was happening, and he got angry at me and gaslighted me, so we left and went back to our home and then I saw the girl who was our old friend at our home and I asked my husband what is he doing here and he was like oh it\u2019s OK she\u2019s not disturbing as she can stay and I was worried disturbed so I wanted to leave the house and I saw my friend for the third time outside of the house and she said oh my dad\u2019s coming and I\u2019m gonna be with him and I said isn\u2019t your father dead you told me that he died years ago ?

In this dream, you are in Bali with your newlywed husband, symbolizing a new and exciting phase in your life. The beach and young people may represent a sense of freedom, fun, and adventure. However, the presence of an old friend, who your husband doesn't like, introduces tension and potential conflict.\n\nThe dream takes a troubling turn when you witness your husband flirting with another young girl. This could stem from your real-life knowledge that he doesn't like the old friend, possibly indicating a fear of infidelity or the feeling of being betrayed. Your feelings of disturbance and confrontation with your husband reflect the anxiety and insecurity you may have about maintaining a strong and faithful relationship.\n\nFurthermore, your husband's gaslighting and dismissal of your concerns reveals a fear of being unheard, invalidated, or manipulated in your waking life. The presence of the old friend in your home and her surprising explanation about her father's death adds to the confusion and unease, reflecting a lack of trust and stability in your relationships.\n\nOverall, this dream symbolizes your fear of losing the intimacy and connection you desire in your marriage. It may be a reflection of important conversations you should have with your husband, addressing your concerns and working towards building a stronger bond based on trust and communication.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "967a2171-28e0-4b10-aeed-d5426f729318", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": null, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "Betrayed at Bali Beach: Dreaming of Infidelity and Unexpected Encounters", "user_id": 944029}]
