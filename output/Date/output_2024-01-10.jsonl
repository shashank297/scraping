The man was baldish, had glasses and wore a striped shirt (I don't know him in real life) \nAnd as me and my family sat to watch TV (it was an old tv in my dream and it did the creepy thing it does in horror movies when the demon is talking through it) and the voice which I didn't recognize said \"Hello AliCat\" (talking to me and thats my childhood nickname) ", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 785709, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/0eec58ed-9d85-443b-93a6-4061ab80f70f.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234609Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=0e9ac1b7cb6e68d97f939c1fd3d19ab68b68a0b6c3519ce98ee60be4154bfd9d", "interpretation": "This dream may suggest feelings of fear, unease, or a sense of being haunted by some negative influence or presence in your life. The devil-like figure symbolizes a malevolent force or negativity that is being perceived by those around you, including your mom. The fact that it always appears on the left-hand side could indicate that it represents a hidden or subconscious aspect of yourself or your life that you are not fully aware of or comfortable with.\n\nThe figure you see in the window reflection may represent your own reflection or perception of yourself, distorted by the influence of this negative force. The baldish appearance, glasses, and striped shirt could simply be random details generated by your subconscious.\n\nThe TV scene, with its creepy horror movie atmosphere, symbolizes the pervasiveness of this negative influence in your life. The voice addressing you by your childhood nickname suggests that this influence may be connected to unresolved issues or traumas from your past.\n\nOverall, this dream could be a reflection of your concerns about negative influences or forces in your life, perhaps related to unresolved childhood issues. It may be worth exploring any hidden fears or unresolved emotions in order to confront and overcome them.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "f7e9eb73-7ee4-4816-b592-191679290543", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": null, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "\"The Sinister Specter: Unveiling the Devil on the Left Hand Side\"", "user_id": 939283}, {"country": "US", "date": "Wed, 10 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I saw these marvelous papers that responded to touch and became alive with growth and guidance and the right thoughts and i held them up to my chest and they became alivw and there were words too of wisdom but all around me was like a coup or the end of ths world or something that we were trying to avoid and there were enemies about to enter to threaten me and after several loving moments with the smart telepathic paper which was alive i asked the papers about dr who and nicole and prophecies and truth and i sensed dr whos displeasure.

They symbolize a source of guidance and inspiration in your life. Holding them up to your chest signifies your desire to embrace and internalize this wisdom.\n\nThe mention of a coup or the end of the world suggests that you feel surrounded by chaos or impending danger in your waking life. This could represent challenges or obstacles that you are trying to avoid or overcome.\n\nThe enemies entering the scene indicates that there are external factors or people who pose a threat to you. This could symbolize feelings of insecurity or conflicts you may be facing.\n\nAsking the papers about Dr. Who, Nicole, prophecies, and truth suggests that you are seeking answers and clarity about certain aspects of your life. The sense of Dr. Who's displeasure could indicate a fear of disapproval or judgment from someone in your life.\n\nThe events that start happening as predicted represent a sense of inevitability or a feeling that certain things are unfolding according to a predetermined plan. The need to have two people in the room and detain them in a specific way implies a need for control or manipulation in order to achieve success.\n\nBeing in a car with friends, with Sonya's mom driving, symbolizes a journey or a transition in your life where you are relying on others for support. The realization that you must outwit them by writing a fictitious but believable series of events suggests that you may need to use strategy or cunning to overcome obstacles. This reflects the power of deception and the importance of adaptability in achieving your goals.\n\nOverall, this dream suggests a desire for knowledge and guidance, a feeling of being threatened or challenged, and the recognition that sometimes manipulation or deception may be necessary to succeed.

Attending a party with your wife's family represents the merging of different aspects of your life and the challenges that can come with it. The inability of the person who was supposed to sing may reflect a disruption or a sense of things not going as planned. The reference to a mafia-like family suggests a perception of power dynamics and potential violence within this group. \n\nYour role in the dream is one of quiet observation and assistance, symbolizing your cautious and non-confrontational approach to the situation. The murder that occurs and is deemed \"normal\" by the family could represent a secret or sinister aspect of their dynamics that you may be aware of but feel powerless to address. \n\nWashing the glasses, forks, and knives could symbolize your desire to clean up or resolve the conflicts and complications surrounding the family. The interaction with your wife's cousins and their kissing of your cheek may represent a sense of acceptance and inclusion despite your differences.\n\nTowards the end of the dream, being offered a job by the family's leader may suggest a potential opportunity or connection being offered to you, possibly based on your loyalty and reliability. The mention of the party being at the beach and the recommendation to leave quickly to avoid bad luck in the morning may signify a desire to escape from a potentially negative or unsafe situation. The worry of your children about your involvement with your wife's family may reflect your concern about the impact of these complicated dynamics on your family life.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "4095272b-b75a-4ae3-8646-7497a86376dd", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "Mafia Family Party: A Troubled Celebration and a Mysterious Offer", "user_id": 805530}]
