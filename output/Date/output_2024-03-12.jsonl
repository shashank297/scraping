I always have dreams of looking for my dad and not being able to find him. At one point I was in KY grandma's garage and looked at the wall and there was multiple plates or plaques of carousel horses and there were 3 that in my mind were the most \"important\" at another point I was at an Italian restaurant and I was going to order a pizza and a beef brisket and bring my dad the brisket for dinner. The whole dream I missed my dad and was wondering where he was. At another point there were these really weird/kinda gross stuffed animals that had live like grub inside and it was squirming and moving. I may have dreamt that because when I was a kid my dad used to buy me Mexican jumping beans and my dad would always tell me there was a worm inside.... ialways that that was interesting. Anyway after the dream I woke up and missed my dad even more realizing he is dead in real life and I will never see him again", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 844333, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/cf898cf0-70b4-4a44-8874-00501dc0edb1.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234741Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f86a15356fa04da36180bb80541b393cdad33641e8c7b90bfc99eca7f44e4e30", "interpretation": "Based on the details you provided, it seems that your dream reflects your deep longing and sadness for your father.
