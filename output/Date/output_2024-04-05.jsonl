I kept beating thr shit out of him and he kept mocking me. He and her would always sleep in some room she hadn't let me on (which doesn't exist in waking life).\n\nThe police and various people showed up on my front porch, and one of my brother's old friends parents started berating me for having a problem with Calvin. The police were initially pretty concerned, but calmed down quickly. One even broke the tension and got me to laugh by pulling two sides of a fake mustache off. \n\nMy old friend's attractive wife came over and started flirting pretty sexually with me. Right away, I assumed my mom and dad had hired her to get my head off of my ex. It turns out her and her husband had separated, to which I said, \"I guess I've been out of the loop a while.\" She was very enticing. My sister came up to me shortly after this and offered to kill my brother in secret and we planned quite a bit. \n\nBetween the porch scene and the seeing my friend's ex wife, there was a random side bit where my mom and I went through some labryinth like the one in True Detective Season 1. Once we got through, we arrived at some poor, slightly hillbilly-seeming home. They were asking if we knew where any convenience stores were open. It was after midnight, and nothing around us is open after midnight. They were going to drive 4 hours north to some place to go ASAP. I told them to try walmart and St. Cloud instead. St. Cloud is only about an hour away and should have something open. After they took my suggestion, they brought me home. \n\n- when my brother was mocking me, he was wearing the creepy white faced mask from Twin Peaks and skipping down the road. He was laughing maniacally and kept giving me the throat slit sign. \n\n- one of the cops looked like Tommy Lee Jones.\n\n- the hillbilly's house looked like mine.\n\n- when the events started we were at my ex's \"house\" (she doesn't have a house, but it looked like a friend of mine's). She had a room where my friend's was, and her \"secret room\" was across the hall from that room. \n\n- the only friend I remember clearly being with my brother was his best friend\n\n- my buddy's ex came in the back door of my house. The rest took place on the front porch or in the living room, and everyone else came in the front.

However, based on the details provided in your dream, I can offer some possible interpretations:\n\n1. Betrayal and Trust Issues: The dream may reflect feelings of betrayal and a lack of trust in your waking life relationships. The presence of your brother and ex sleeping around behind your back suggests a sense of betrayal and deception. This could indicate deep-seated trust issues or anxieties related to relationships and loyalty.\n\n2. Power Struggles and Insecurity: The ongoing conflict between you and your brother in the dream, with him mocking you, could represent power struggles and feelings of insecurity. This may point to a real-life rivalry or competition that you feel you are losing, causing frustration and anger. The imagery of beating your brother suggests a desire for control or to assert yourself in the situation.\n\n3. External Perspectives and Validation: The presence of various people, including the police and your brother's friend's parents, may symbolize the influence of external perspectives on your emotions and actions. The police initially being concerned but then calming down could represent your fear of consequences or judgments for your reactions. The interaction with the police officer and the fake mustache represents a momentary release of tension, possibly highlighting the need for humor and perspective when dealing with difficult situations.\n\n4. Emotional Distractions: The encounter with your friend's attractive wife and the assumption that your mom and dad hired her to distract you from your ex implies a desire for emotional distractions or escapism. This may suggest a need to focus on other aspects of your life or explore new relationships to move on from past hurts.\n\n5. Hidden Agendas and Conspiracy: The offer from your sister to kill your brother in secret reflects a greater desire for revenge or a solution to the perceived betrayal. This suggests a hidden agenda or a desire for justice that you may be struggling with internally.\n\n6. Uncertainty and Guidance: The labyrinth-like journey with your mom and the encounter with the individuals seeking help for finding open convenience stores may symbolize feelings of confusion, a need for guidance, or a search for certainty in your waking life. Your role in helping them find a solution suggests a desire to find solutions and offer support to others, despite your own challenges.\n\nIt is important to remember that these interpretations are based solely on the details you provided, and only you can truly understand the personal significance of your dream.
