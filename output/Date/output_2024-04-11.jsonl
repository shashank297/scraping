[{"country": "US", "date": "Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "\nI dreamt I was leading children\u2019s church. We basically started a gospel rave and the children started to get filled with the Holy Ghost, speaking in tongues. But the doors were closed so we had it under control. I was dancing with the kids, it was lit. We had a DJ instead of live music. The room was also dark with only rave lights and glow sticks.\n\nThe pastor was about to preach bout the youth room was right next door at the back of church by the entrance.\n\nHe told some of the ushers and ministers to speak to us to keep it down. But when they opened the doors, all the children ran out. We also had special needs children in the room so all the parents were asking me and the other helpers where they were. I told them they were running all about the church so then need to go find them.\n\nThe DJ doesn\u2019t even know the kids left, he\u2019s still bumping the music. So the sound is filling the church, service is disrupted and everything is in chaos. No one can even stop the DJ.\n\nThe head usher (a woman) makes an announcement for all off duty ushers to help in the youth room. All the other officers (I.e. ministers, deacons, missionaries, etc) start helping too.\n\nThis one boy is filled with the Holy Ghost, walking up the center aisle carrying his deaf and dumb little sister to the alter/pulpit. When they reach he drops his sister and she starts running around speaking in tongues.\n\nThe Pastor is still on the pulpit amazed at all that is happening.\n\nThere was this wheelchair bound boy.\nThe boy\u2019s mother came up to me crying asking me where he was because she went to the room and all she found was his wheelchair. He was running around the church so I pointed at him but I left her because I was trying to help get the other kids under control.\n\nShe called her husband crying because she was happy he could walk again but she couldn\u2019t get out the words since she was overwhelmed. Her husband thought something was wrong so he came to the church.\n\nWhen he opened the door I yelled no but it was too late, his boy ran out the church and up the street. I told one of the ministers \u201ccall 911, I don\u2019t know if I can catch him,\u201d and ran after him. Mind you, I am full of the Holy Ghost with these kids, I just have self control cause I\u2019m an adult.\n\nI was in a skirt, dressed like a deacon but since I had to run full speed, the skirt ripped and my black heels broke off. The boy started running faster than the cars and I was trailing on the highway. Other people from church started following us in their cars to try and catch us. I remember this one white jeep looking car cause it looked like it was made in the 70s but it still had power. It looked like a church on wheels for a car.\n\nWe start running on the highway but we are catching up with the cars. Everyone going like 40 mph but they are still amazed we\u2019re catching up and running faster.\n\nWe started a high speed chase on the highway but the reporters started cursing while reporting cause they couldn\u2019t believe we were on foot. They would say \u201cwtf, is this real\u201d or \u201cyou gotta be shitting me, are you lying?\u201d\n\nPeople are are trying to livestream and record us for social media as we run past their cars.\n\nThe cops couldn\u2019t catch up with us after a while and the helicopter cam was starting to have trouble keeping up. Cops are trying to clear the highway and stop us before we leave the state.\n\nA black suv Lincoln shows up and bolts past the cops, it\u2019s the pastor\u2019s car. The pastor, the head usher woman, another minister woman and deacon man came driving beside us. They try talking the boy down but because they\u2019re warriors, them speaking to him actually empowers him to run faster.\n\nThey tell me I need to catch him but I tell them I can\u2019t keep up. They say for me to run in front of the car and they will push me, so I do.\n\nWhen I finally get close enough to grab the boys hand, the connection turns him into a ball of speed white fire. And you see bolt of regular flame that is me trailing behind him as he drags me. I tell God that I can\u2019t stop him so He said He would strengthen me. I\u2019m only hearing God as I watch like from the camera view of the helicopter. \n\nI transform into a ball of flaming sunset colors and instantly keep up behind the boy. The head usher gets the idea that everyone in the car should hold hands. She climbs on the hood and the pastor holds her left hand since he\u2019s driving, the second holds her right and the deacon lady is in the middle inside the car. But I also feel like someone is on top of the car to keep the usher from falling off but it\u2019s 4. When they connect their car catches up to us.\n\nWe look like a straight line of fire on the highway.\n\nThe president gets word and sends the army for us. They said they were gonna bomb us but someone told the army that we were people.\n\nBefore I woke up I heard someone whisper \u201cthe power of 4\u201d.", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 923565, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/f1684550-d51b-4f77-a786-9dacbd44d3be.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234836Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=4b83dc4c9cfbf88ac220416e57f2fd0a7ea3fbf5957d9c21de88659e969c1de5", "interpretation": "This dream is filled with vivid symbolism and imagery, so let's break it down:\n\nThe dream starts with you leading children's church, which symbolizes your role in guiding or nurturing others. The gospel rave and the children getting filled with the Holy Ghost represent an atmosphere of spiritual ecstasy and connection with the divine. The closed doors symbolize control and containment, suggesting that this experience is happening within a particular setting or under certain conditions.\n\nThe presence of a DJ instead of live music and the dark room with rave lights and glow sticks suggest a modern and energetic approach to worship and religious experiences.\n\nThe interruption and chaos begin when the doors are opened and the children run out. This represents a loss of control and a disruption of the intended order. The special needs children running around the church may reflect the idea that spiritual experiences are not limited to specific individuals or groups.\n\nThe fact that the DJ is unaware of the chaos and continues playing music symbolizes the persistence of spiritual energy even in the midst of disturbances.\n\nThe involvement of the head usher and other church officers in trying to control the situation suggests the need for authority figures to intervene and restore order.\n\nThe boy carrying his deaf and dumb little sister to the altar, where she starts speaking in tongues, signifies the power of the Holy Spirit to overcome limitations and disabilities.\n\nThe mother of the wheelchair-bound boy finding his wheelchair empty but then witnessing him running and walking represents a sense of liberation, transformation, and healing.\n\nYour pursuit of the boy who runs away, with others from the church joining you, showcases the determination and desire to bring someone back to safety and control.\n\nThe torn skirt and broken heels may symbolize the sacrifice and physical limitations you experience in your pursuit. However, you remain filled with the Holy Spirit and able to maintain self-control.\n\nThe high-speed chase on the highway, the amazement of onlookers, and the presence of reporters suggest that the extraordinary nature of the situation is attracting attention and curiosity.\n\nThe inability of the authorities (cops and helicopter) to catch up with you, as well as the mention of livestreaming and social media, implies that this spiritual experience transcends the limitations of worldly power and awareness.\n\nThe arrival of the pastor's car with the head usher, minister, and deacon seems to represent a higher level of spiritual authority and guidance. However, their attempts to reason with the boy only make him stronger, suggesting that the spiritual journey requires a personal connection and surrender to a higher power.\n\nYour transformation into a ball of flaming sunset colors and ability to keep up with the boy symbolize your empowerment and alignment with the divine. The connection between you and the boy turns him into a ball of white fire, representing a shared connection and acceleration of spiritual energy.\n\nThe idea of holding hands to maintain connection and speed highlights the need for unity and support in spiritual journeys. The mention of \"the power of 4\" at the end suggests that there is strength and significance in the number four, potentially referring to stability, balance, or the four elements.\n\nThe mention of the president sending the army and their intention to bomb you but then realizing that you are people signifies a misunderstanding or underestimation of the power and spiritual nature of your journey.\n\nOverall, this dream seems to convey themes of spiritual ecstasy, disruption, healing, guidance, perseverance, and the transcendence of worldly limitations. It suggests that there is a powerful spiritual journey, perhaps guided by a higher power, where unity, surrender, and connection with the divine lead to transformative experiences.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": null, "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "\"The Gospel Rave: Children Filled with the Holy Ghost\"", "user_id": 781198}, {"country": "US", "date": "Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "i had a dream about a snake \n", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 923433, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/346c23f9-f457-4ed5-91fe-cebea10297e3.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234836Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=be41597725ecffdfb72ac9e1ccfffe492e3b4233f1994fd12c4012d35a576d34", "interpretation": "Dreams about snakes can have a variety of meanings depending on the context and personal associations of the dreamer.

It could imply that you possess valuable skills or qualities that allow you to empathize with and assist others during significant changes or challenges.\n\nAdditionally, the camp setting suggests a temporary or transitional state.

I was set a summer camp style area that I was at but anyway I was in a big bathroom I like some dorm bathrooms to set up my other schools you like our bunch of toilets out, showers out, and the way that the toilets were like 2 walls with 2 kinds of short walls probably come up low but higher than your waist and that's it. And so I was in the bathroom and I'm trying to do things to not touch the toilet seat so I'm like I balancing my feet like on the little bars on the wall to try hover over the toilet seat to pee.
