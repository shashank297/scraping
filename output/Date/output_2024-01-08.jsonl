[{"country": "US", "date": "Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I flew to Puerto Rico to visit a tiktoker to learn a new recipe. She lived on the top floor of her apartment next to the beach. She was so nice and inviting. Her husband took the kids to the beach so we could start cooking. The meal was Asian inspired and smelled wonderful. She got a phone call and said she had to pick up her mom from the train station. She asked me to stay to keep an eye on the meal. A few moments later I heard sirens. They were so loud. I looked out the window and could see her husband holding the kids and his face looked so panicked. When I looked up I could see a tsunami heading our way. I began to cry and panic because I didn't know what to do. I opened the door and didn't see any neighbors.  I closed the door went to the middle of the floor curled up into a ball to brace myself for impact. Moments later I felt the building shake and a lot of noise. When it was over I finally heard people leaving their apartments. So I left to. When I got outside there was dead bodies everywhere. I had to climb a hill filled with dead bodies. I had to scale a building to get to safety. I was scared to fall because I knew I would die. Once I got to safety I headed back home and went to work. One of the supervisors says hey I heard you were in a tsunami then he handed me a pumpkin and I felt confused. I raced with another coworker to set the pumpkin in a conference room.

Flying to Puerto Rico and visiting a TikToker may symbolize a desire for new experiences, learning, and possibly seeking inspiration. The top floor apartment next to the beach represents a peaceful and inviting environment.\n\nThe Asian-inspired meal and the pleasant atmosphere with the TikToker could symbolize a sense of creativity, enjoyment, and satisfaction in exploring new things. However, the phone call and her leaving to pick up her mom may represent a sudden shift or interruption in your plans or expectations.\n\nThe sirens and the husband's panicked face may reflect a sense of danger or anxiety creeping into your life. The tsunami heading towards you signifies a powerful and overwhelming emotional experience or challenge that you feel unprepared for. This can trigger feelings of panic and a sense of helplessness, as seen in your reaction.\n\nThe lack of neighbors and dead bodies in the aftermath of the tsunami suggest feelings of isolation, loss, and the harsh realities of life. Climbing the hill filled with dead bodies may symbolize the difficulties and obstacles you feel you must overcome to reach safety or find a sense of stability.\n\nHeading back home and going to work afterward implies a sense of resilience and the need to continue with your daily routines despite the challenges faced. The interaction with your supervisor mentioning the tsunami and the confusion with the pumpkin may represent the disparity between the severity of your experience and the superficiality of others' perceptions or reactions. Racing to set the pumpkin in a conference room suggests a sense of urgency or pressure to fit into certain expectations or fulfill responsibilities.\n\nOverall, the dream may reflect your subconscious feelings of vulnerability, unexpected challenges, and the need for support and adaptation in the face of difficult situations. It could also highlight the contrast between personal experiences and how others may view or respond to them.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "c12404a1-6b4d-48de-bd32-013dbeeb2ab6", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "Terror and Survival: A Harrowing Tsunami Escape in Puerto Rico Leads to Unexpected Encounters and a Bizarre Workplace Task", "user_id": 937343}, {"country": "US", "date": "Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I was home resting In a hospital bed and couldn't move.
