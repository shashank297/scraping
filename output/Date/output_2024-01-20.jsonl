Being in Israel with him may symbolize a journey or experience that you both shared, which still holds significance for you. The idea of being rebellious refugees suggests a feeling of being displaced or not fitting in within the relationship. \n\nThe wait for five minutes and watching a Disney movie represents the time spent in hesitant anticipation, perhaps hesitating to confront the emotions or memories associated with the past relationship. Planning to watch all of the movie later suggests a desire to revisit and understand these unresolved feelings. \n\nThe moment where your ex-boyfriend puts his hand in the fold of your back signifies a sense of desire and closeness, but the feeling of manipulating him suggests guilt or uncertainty about your true intentions. This could imply a need for self-reflection and honesty in your relationships.\n\nThe difficulty of getting up and dealing with your belongings as the time is up reflects the challenge of moving on and letting go of the past. It signifies the struggle in confronting and resolving these unresolved emotions and finding closure.\n\nOverall, this dream suggests that you may need to explore and understand your emotions towards your past relationship in order to move forward and find peace within yourself.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "9363caf8-bdd8-425a-93a6-27468be89aab", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": null, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "\"Rebellious Refugees in Israel: Disney Movies, Forbidden Desires, and the Perils of Return\"", "user_id": 840328}, {"country": "US", "date": "Sat, 20 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I once had a dream that the Titan TV Man finally returned in the Skibidi Toilet series.
