In the back seat was a little boy with blue eyes. He was excited to see me but then cried like he missed me. She turned to him and comforted him. We talked and said we missed eachother and that we were glad to see eachother. She apologized for the break up and that she wants to have me in her life in any capacity she can but that she knows we can\u2019t be together. We kissed and it was warm and so many feelings came up.

Running into your ex's friend and being invited over may represent a desire for connection and reconciliation. The hugs with your ex's friend and brother could symbolize a sense of familiarity and comfort from your past relationship.\n\nSeeing your ex pass by in the car, reversing, and opening the door for you suggests that there may still be a part of you that longs for a reconnection with your ex. The presence of the little boy with blue eyes in the backseat could represent the innocence and purity of the relationship you once had. His excitement and subsequent crying may reflect the conflicting emotions within you, indicating a mix of longing, sadness, and nostalgia.\n\nYour ex comforting the little boy may symbolize her attempt to soothe any lingering pain or sadness from the breakup. Apologizing for the breakup and expressing a desire to have you in her life in any capacity could indicate a genuine desire for friendship and a willingness to maintain a connection.\n\nThe warm kiss and the rush of emotions that follow suggest that even though you understand that a romantic relationship is not possible, there is still a deep emotional connection and love between the two of you.\n\nOverall, this dream may be a reflection of your unresolved feelings towards your ex and a longing for emotional closure or reconnection in some form. It could be beneficial to explore these emotions and consider what role you would like your ex to play in your life moving forward.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "dde28a98-84f0-4950-9b0b-6b206b25dd37", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "Embracing the Past: A Reunion, Apology, and Bittersweet Kiss", "user_id": 936204}, {"country": "US", "date": "Sat, 06 Jan 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I was walking in the woods during winter.

The presence of the grey wolf symbolizes your instinctual nature or perhaps an aspect of your own personality that you perceive as wild or untamed.\n\nThe fact that you were not afraid of the wolf indicates a sense of comfort with your own instincts and a lack of fear or concern about embracing the more primal aspects of yourself. The interaction between you and the wolf, in which you both paused and observed one another, suggests a mutual recognition and understanding.\n\nThe appearance of people on the trail represents external influences or social pressures entering your personal space. By warning the wolf about the approaching people, it demonstrates your ability to navigate social situations and concern for the well-being of others.\n\nMoreover, the wolf's decision to heed your advice and move away from the trail implies that you possess a strong connection with your instincts and have the capability to guide and influence others in their decision-making processes.\n\nOverall, this dream suggests a harmonious integration of your instinctual nature, intuition, and social awareness. It may be an indication of your ability to assert yourself and provide guidance both for yourself and for those around you in navigating life's challenges.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "7650f021-0e7b-44ce-bd34-6c7c102583c4", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "The Lone Encounter: A Winter's Tale with the Grey Wolf", "user_id": 936204}]
