I was sitting on a couch and there were documents besides be. I looked at then and saw my file and that i was scored 10/10 and there was a * sign on my name. I knew that this score and a star meant my empathy/ability to read people and help them. Then i looked at another page and saw another girl\u2019s file. She was my classmate at highschool. Her score was 6/10. Then I knew I was chosen for something, that I was a favourite. Then the women came up and took the file from me because I wasn\u2019t allowed to look at it. But she wasn\u2019t mad. Then I understood that she was blind and deaf - but she could sense everything as if she wasn\u2019t. Her actions were acurate. She was quite young - maybe 30-40years old and she was beautiful, very soft features. Then me and that woman were outsite something like in a town. There were a lot of people walking and there were a lot of bridges. Some were wavy. The woman was standing behind my right shoulder and she was calming me and at the same time encouraging me. All because she had a plan for me to do something of importance. At that moment she was just encouraging me to move slowly, take my time, first learn to walk stright and balanced. Then she said that big things are coming, big changes for earth evolution. I knew then that she was Gaia - personification of earth, a spirit. At one moment I saw her as a very tall 5-6 meters vine going up to the sky. And then I went my way into the town.

The office setting and important agents represent a symbolic authority figure or higher power who acknowledges your abilities and empathy (represented by the high score and star on your file). The presence of your classmate with a lower score may suggest a comparison of your abilities to others, highlighting your uniqueness and favoritism.\n\nThe blind and deaf woman in the dream signifies intuition and heightened senses, indicating that even though she lacks physical sight and hearing, she possesses a deep understanding and insight. Her beauty and soft features may symbolize the nurturing and gentle nature of this intuitive guidance.\n\nBeing outside in a town with bridges represents a transitional phase or crossing to a new chapter in your life. The wavy bridges and the woman standing behind your right shoulder, calming and encouraging you, symbolize the need for balance and stability as you navigate these changes. Gaia, personifying the Earth, suggests a connection to nature and the importance of aligning with the earth's energy and purpose.\n\nThe tall vine reaching towards the sky could symbolize growth, expansion, and a higher consciousness, emphasizing the significant role you may play in the evolution and positive transformation of the world.\n\nOverall, this dream suggests that you are being recognized for your unique abilities, guided by intuitive wisdom, and encouraged to embrace changes with balance and purpose.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "4692b843-49d6-40d5-810c-a8505f8bd18e", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "The Empathetic Chosen One: A Vision of Gaia's Guidance", "user_id": 959779}, {"country": "US", "date": "Sun, 18 Feb 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I am a woman who visited my friend today and fell asleep in her chair in her living room in real Waking Life she has a little white birch tree that has just lights on it no leaves.
