At first I was really good at taking my classes, but soon the days dragged on and I was struggling to focus on anything or get anything done. Then I met a boy who said he worked on this cruise ship his entire life, he looked Mexican but I think he was Indian. He said he was named after Krishna but that he didn't like the name because he is Christain, nor did he like the 100 something. While he was talking the ship was tipping and it overturned and drowned him, the liquid felt kind of real and I saw that he was dead, I reached out my hand to his so that he would not be alone. I knew I wasn't going to live and so I looked upward reminding myself of the resurrection. Then I woke up in my bed and my mom and aunt were trying to get me to choose which dinner to feed my brother and I kept having to remind myself I was asleep which would reset the dream. \n", "generated_artwork": true, "id": 833895, "image_url": "https://flask-aws-demo.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/24cbec2a-6ce3-45e2-9417-b20d0ae8d6a7.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIATSTPHBMT3B2G7XV5%2F20240421%2Fus-east-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240421T234735Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=db0ae6413c98e63bb6915029764d1121e7449cc6f3a9608460b6e16d5f4a5b16", "interpretation": "This dream seems to reflect some underlying emotions and concerns you may have in your waking life.\n\nThe cruise ship symbolizes your journey through your college courses.

There's a small carnival/festival with rides and games, and everyone looks like they're having a good time. Besides all my immediate coworkers, my moms side of the family, and my boyfriend, I didn't recognize anyone else there. A particular area I kept walking past was a long street, wide like a boardwalk. Three shady individuals were tucked to the right side, and they were drug dealers. The other two seemed blurry and generic, but the main one I interacted with very detailed, though I've never seen him before. To the left was a nearby apartment/hotel room that I presume was for me and my family. If/when I entered the apartment/hotel, my family was having dinner inside. I remember bringing one of my coworkers inside the apartment. I never brought anyone out. At one point, I'm walking my boyfriend to the apartment, and he goes ahead of me. The detailed drug dealer beckons to me, asking if I want to buy some drugs, and I decline. This upsets him, and he grabs me. I started screaming for my boyfriend. He's not even looking. In fact, it looks like he's smiling at something. Somehow, I break free from the drug dealers grip, and I get away without taking any drugs. My boyfriend seemingly disappears. The dream takes an abrupt turn when a slow moving missile (that resembles a Japanese can of Coca-cola) In this point in the dream, I discover I'm on some sort of vacation, and the presence of a missle scared me enough where I wanted to go home. It cuts to me sitting at a red light in the same town. It's fairly normal until I start seeing objects slowly flying towards me. I try to tell myself it's a kite or something until I LITERALLY see the ferris wheel from the festival casually flying with people in it. I start looking around to see if people see what I see. I realize the light changed, and I'm sitting six car spaces away from the other cars on the road, so I hurry and turn left at the light. I'm frantically trying to leave the area, basically driving in circles, almost hitting scammers trying to get hit on purpose, and seeing more flying objects.

They're holding what I'm guessing was glasses of champagne or wine, and the pool water was orange instead. My sister said it was probably because of the drinks. The pool wasn't big so they hardly had any space. It was a weird sight. In the next scene I'm at Walmart, the store, with my mom and sister, I'm not sure if my dad was there. My mom didn't seem happy and me and my sister were angry about something. We were in a almost closed off section where paintings were hung, and we were looking at them. But I left the area and walked around. Soon I realized I couldn't find my way back, and all the men around seemed very suspicious. I was lost. I tried to stay away from all the men, but soon ones that looked either old or homeless started trying to kidnap me. And there was one who seemed fine and young, but we got into a physical fight, I don't remember why. I was doing good but then my attacks stopped hurting him and my moves were slowing and weakening. But i got away. There was also a green man in a wheelchair after me, and he tried trapping me when I ran passed him. But I got away from him too. I wondered if my family had forgotten about me and left. I thought about checking the parking lot for their car but I didn't. At some point I think I saw my sister again, still angry, in the distance. We met up, but I must've lost her again somehow. Then I remembered I could just call them! So I asked a lady where the bathroom is, and she shows me, it was basically right in front of me and I didn't realize. So I went in and searched my bag for my phone, but took out an mp3 instead.

Encountering the gunmen holding people hostage reveals your awareness of the presence of threats or negative influences in your surroundings.\n\nWhen you draw your gun and fire at the gunman, it symbolizes your desire to defend yourself and take control of the situation. However, the fact that your bullet doesn't harm him and it turns out to be an elaborate joke on you suggests a feeling of powerlessness or a lack of control in your waking life. This may indicate that you often feel deceived or manipulated by others.\n\nThe failed attempt to teleport home using your phone app represents your longing for a quick fix or an easy escape from your current circumstances. Its malfunction implies that there are no easy solutions to your problems and that you need to face them directly.\n\nFinally, discovering your trashed house infested with ants represents feelings of disorder, turmoil, and dissatisfaction in your personal life. Vacuuming them up symbolizes your attempt to regain control and eliminate the nuisances or challenges that are bothering you.\n\nOverall, this dream suggests that you may be dealing with unresolved fears, a desire for escapism, a lack of control, and a need to confront and overcome the obstacles in your waking life.", "lat": null, "leap_image_id": "21c89298-361c-4fbf-b6b0-989f90322b12", "long": null, "moderation_flagged": false, "regenerated": null, "satisfied": true, "staged_for_deletion": false, "title": "\"High School Secrets: Gunfire, Heroes, and Teleportation Mishaps\"", "user_id": 709281}, {"country": "SK", "date": "Fri, 08 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT", "dream": "I had a dream that my boyfriend and i were in thailand and told me he already bought a ticket home and told me to buy one as well. and it was strange that he didn't tell me he was buying a ticket so i understood that he had an idea to go home alone and not tell me but because he told me it meant that for some reason he changed his mind. it was alarming and felt unsafe. then i left and started walking through some private people yards. there were a lot of farm animals, like goats.
