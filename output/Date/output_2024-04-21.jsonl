The consideration of going underground but ultimately choosing not to could indicate a reluctance or inability to hide or escape from difficult situations.\n\nThe voice that speaks about how its face was on everything and the presence of multiple moons suggest a heightened sense of supernatural or divine influence in the dream. The altered view of the Earth, with a permanently darker and dimmer atmosphere, represents a significant change or shift in your perception of the world.\n\nThe poll created by your friend about the second coming of Christ or the antichrist reflects a sense of spiritual or moral uncertainty and a need for clarity or guidance in your waking life. Your answer of \"I don't know\" suggests a lack of certainty or definitive understanding about the situation.\n\nOverall, this dream may be highlighting your feelings of fear, uncertainty, and a need for direction or clarity during a challenging or uncertain time in your waking life.

I was dating this random old white man who then cheated on me with Angela (my good friend from k-12) who then cheated on her with RicoNasty/Taylor(UNCC). The shit was wild. Also, Angela was using my phone to talk to this man. Rico Taylor sent me a message saying that she and that man hated me which was wild and I started taking screenshots of this guys messages with me and Angela to send to her... them?....
